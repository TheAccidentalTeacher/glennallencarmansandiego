# Phase 2 Completion Summary: Data Models & Database Design

## âœ… Completed Components

### 1. Database Schema (`database/schema.sql`)
- **Users table**: Authentication and user management
- **Villains table**: Character storage with difficulty levels
- **Locations table**: Comprehensive geographical data with cultural/economic info
- **Cases table**: Game scenarios linking villains to locations
- **Clues table**: Progressive reveal system with scoring
- **Game Sessions table**: Real-time session management with status tracking
- **Teams table**: Team management and customization
- **Session Teams**: Many-to-many relationship for team participation
- **Score Events**: Detailed scoring system with event types
- **Warrant Submissions**: Final guess tracking with validation
- **Revealed Clues**: Session-specific clue reveal tracking

**Key Features:**
- UUID primary keys throughout
- Proper foreign key relationships
- Indexes for performance optimization
- Automatic timestamp updates
- Constraint validation

### 2. Sample Data (`database/sample_data.sql`)
- Sample users (teacher and admin accounts)
- Sourdough Pete and Wheat Wrangler villains
- Three diverse locations: Istanbul (Turkey), Lima (Peru), Marrakech (Morocco)
- Two complete cases with progressive clue systems
- Sample teams for testing

### 3. Database Service Layer (`src/services/database.ts`)
- PostgreSQL connection pool management
- Connection testing and health checks
- Query execution with logging
- Transaction support for complex operations
- Graceful shutdown handling

### 4. User Management (`src/services/userService.ts`)
- User creation with bcrypt password hashing
- Email and ID-based user lookup
- Password validation and authentication
- User profile updates
- User deletion and listing with pagination

### 5. Authentication System (`src/services/authService.ts`)
- JWT token generation and verification
- Access and refresh token support
- Password reset token generation
- Token expiration checking
- Secure token extraction from headers

### 6. Game Session Management (`src/services/gameSessionService.ts`)
- Session creation with unique codes
- Team management and joining
- Session status updates (waiting/active/paused/completed)
- Round progression tracking
- Score event logging
- Team score aggregation and leaderboards

### 7. Content Management (`src/services/contentService.ts`)
- Case creation and management
- Villain and location services
- Content filtering by creator
- Search functionality for locations
- Content status management (active/inactive)

### 8. State Management (`src/services/gameStore.ts`)
- Zustand store for game state
- Session and team management
- Score tracking and aggregation
- Clue reveal state
- Warrant submission tracking

### 9. TypeScript Interfaces (`src/types/index.ts`)
**Updated core interfaces:**
- `User` and `CreateUserData` for authentication
- `GameSession` with database-aligned properties
- `SessionTeam` for team management
- `ScoreEvent` with comprehensive event tracking
- Updated to match database schema exactly

### 10. Environment Configuration
- `.env.example` with documented variables
- Database URL configuration
- JWT secret management
- Environment-specific settings

### 11. Build System Updates
- Fixed PostCSS configuration for Tailwind CSS
- Resolved TypeScript strict mode issues
- Updated package dependencies for database operations
- Successful build pipeline validation

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### Database Design Principles
- **Normalized schema** with proper relationships
- **Performance optimized** with strategic indexes
- **Scalable design** supporting multiple concurrent sessions
- **Audit trail** with created/updated timestamps
- **Data integrity** with constraints and foreign keys

### Security Features
- **Password hashing** with bcrypt
- **JWT authentication** with configurable expiration
- **SQL injection protection** with parameterized queries
- **Environment variable** security for secrets

### Performance Considerations
- **Connection pooling** for database efficiency
- **Query optimization** with targeted indexes
- **Pagination support** for large data sets
- **Batch operations** for bulk updates

### Error Handling
- **Database connection** error management
- **JWT verification** with graceful failures
- **Query error** logging and recovery
- **Transaction rollback** for data consistency

## ðŸš€ Ready for Phase 3

**Database Foundation**: Complete and tested
