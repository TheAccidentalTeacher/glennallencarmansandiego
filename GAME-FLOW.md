- "They invented pizza and pasta, and their flag has red, white, and green stripes"

**Economic:**
- "They use euros for money and are famous for making cars like BMW"
- "This country grows lots of rice and makes electronics like Samsung phones"
- "They mine lots of diamonds and gold, and use rand for currency"

### ‚ùå BAD CLUE EXAMPLES (too complex):

**Geographic:**
- "Oceanic plates dive beneath continental margins, creating peaks that scrape the sky"
- "Subduction zones create orogenic belts with metamorphic core complexes"
- "Glacial isostatic adjustment affects post-glacial rebound patterns"

**Cultural:**

**Student Task**: Use globe to identify border countries
**Example**: "This country borders France and Portugal"

**Round 5: Capital & Final Capture**
**Focus**: Capital city, final villain reveal, Syndicate connection
**Student Task**: Locate capital city on map
**Example**: "The villain is hiding near the famous tower in the capital city that starts with 'P'"

### 3-Round Template (Express Journey)

**Round 1: Geographic & Cultural Foundation**
**Focus**: Location, shape, major landforms + cultural elements
**Student Task**: Find country using physical features AND cultural clues
**Example**: "A boot-shaped Mediterranean country famous for pasta and pizza"

**Round 2: Economic & Border Analysis**

## IMAGE USAGE STRATEGY

Each villain has 5 images that should guide the story progression:
- **Image 1**: Introduction to villain's base region
- **Image 2**: First country clues (geographic features visible)
- **Image 3**: Second country clues (cultural elements visible)
- **Image 4**: Third country clues (economic/social elements)
- **Image 5**: Final hideout/capture scene

## ASSESSMENT & SUCCESS METRICS

### Formative Assessment During Play
Teachers can assess student learning in real-time by listening for:
- **Geographic Reasoning**: "I found it by looking for the boot shape on the map"
- **Cultural Connections**: "The pasta clue made me think of Italy, so I checked Europe"
- **Economic Logic**: "They use euros, so it must be in the European Union"
- **Research Skills**: "I checked three different sources and they all say the same thing"

### Post-Game I-Can Assessment
After each case, students should be able to demonstrate:

**‚úÖ For 5-Round Games:**
- Successfully locate all 5 countries on a blank map
- Explain one geographic, cultural, and economic fact about each country
- Describe how the countries are connected (borders, regions, etc.)
- Summarize the villain's geographic specialty and why these locations mattered

**‚úÖ For 3-Round Games:**
- Successfully locate all 3 countries and explain their connections
- Identify the main geographic theme (mountains, deserts, islands, etc.)
- Describe cultural and economic similarities/differences between countries
- Explain the villain's plan and how geography made it possible

### Quality Clue Standards
A good clue should:
- ‚úÖ Be understandable by an 11-year-old reading independently
- ‚úÖ Require students to physically use a globe or map
- ‚úÖ Contain specific items to research (foods, landmarks, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Lead logically to the next country in the sequence
- ‚úÖ Match the visual evidence in the accompanying image
- ‚úÖ Support the stated I-Can learning objectives

**The gold standard**: If a student can solve the clue using only complex academic explanations, the clue is TOO HARD. If they can solve it by just looking at pictures, it's TOO EASY. The sweet spot requires **active research with physical geography tools** while building toward clear learning targets.

### Teacher Implementation Guide

**Before the Game:**
1. Review Learning Targets with students
2. Ensure research materials are available (globes, atlases, encyclopedias)
3. Explain how students will demonstrate their learning

**During the Game:**
- Listen for students using geographic vocabulary correctly
- Observe research strategies and tool usage
- Note which students need support with specific skills
- Encourage collaborative problem-solving

**After the Game:**
- Have students demonstrate their I-Can statements
- Discuss how the geographic concepts connect to broader themes
- Review successful research strategies used
- Connect learning to upcoming geography units

### Curriculum Alignment Notes
These I-Can statements align with:
- **National Geography Standards** (especially Standards 1, 3, 4, 9, and 10)
- **Common Core Social Studies** (geography and research skills)
- **State Geography Standards** (adaptable to local requirements)
- **21st Century Skills** (research, collaboration, critical thinking)
