She thinks she's protecting the environment, but taking things that don't belong to you is wrong! Follow the clues using your maps, globes, and research skills to find her snowy mountain hideout.</p><p><strong>What You'll Need:</strong> World map, map of Europe, globe, atlas, and internet for research about European mountains and snow</p><p><strong>Snow Mountain Detective Challenge:</strong> Dr. Meridian loves studying snow, ice, and cold mountain weather. Can you follow her trail through 5 Alpine clues?</p>",
