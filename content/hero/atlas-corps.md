# The Atlas Corps
*Geographic Detective Agency - Student Field Manual*

## Who You Are üó∫Ô∏è

Welcome to the **Atlas Corps**, cadet! You're now part of an elite international network of geography detectives. While the Sourdough Syndicate creates elaborate geographic puzzles around the world, it's YOUR job to solve them using your map skills, geographic knowledge, and teamwork.

## Your Mission
**"Turn geographic mysteries into learning adventures."**

The Sourdough Syndicate isn't really "bad" - they're more like puzzle-masters who test your geography skills. Every time you solve one of their cases, both sides win: you learn amazing things about our world, and they get to see their clever puzzles solved by smart students.

## How This Works

### Your Role: **Corps Cadet**
- Use atlases, globes, and maps to track down villains
- Work in teams to solve geographic mysteries
- Learn real skills that help you understand our world

### Your Teacher: **Field Coordinator** 
- Guides your missions and helps when you're stuck
- Makes sure you have the right tools and maps
- Celebrates your detective successes

### Your Mission Control: **Atlas Control**
- The friendly voice that briefs you on each case
- Provides clues and updates as you investigate
- Connects each case to the bigger picture

### Your Targets: **Sourdough Syndicate Specialists**
These aren't really "bad guys" - they're geography experts who create educational challenges:
- **Dr. Altiplano** (Mountain Specialist) - Tests your elevation and highland knowledge
- **Professor Tectonic** (Earthquake Expert) - Challenges your understanding of volcanoes and seismic zones
- **Dr. Coral** (Ocean Specialist) - Explores islands and marine geography
- *...and 10 more geography specialists*

## Your Tools üîß

## How Each Mission Works

### 1. Mission Briefing
Atlas Control explains what the Syndicate specialist is up to and why you need to track them down.

### 2. Investigation Phase  
You get clues one at a time. Each clue tests different geography skills:
- Reading physical features on maps
- Understanding climate and weather
- Identifying countries and regions
- Connecting geographic patterns

### 3. Location Tracking
Use your clues to narrow down where the villain is hiding. Make educated guesses on the world map!

### 4. Mission Success
When you find the villain, they congratulate you on your detective skills and you learn what geographic concept they were teaching.
