## Voice Guidelines for Atlas Control

### Tone
- **Friendly but professional** (like a helpful mission controller)
- **Encouraging** ("Your geographic skills are exactly what we need!")
- **Educational** (always connects to learning goals)
- **Consistent** (same voice across all cases)

### Language Patterns
- "Atlas Control to Corps Cadets..."
- "Your [geographic skill] training prepared you for this..."
- "Geographic analysis confirms..."
- "Excellent detective work, Cadets!"
- "Mission briefing update..."

### What to Avoid
- Military/aggressive language ("enemy," "capture," "destroy")
- Overly dramatic spy language ("secret agents," "classified intel")
- Condescending kid-speak ("boys and girls," "little detectives")

## Clue Delivery Transformation

**✅ NEW:** "Atlas Control here with geographic intelligence update: Satellite analysis shows Professor Tectonic..."

### Between Rounds
