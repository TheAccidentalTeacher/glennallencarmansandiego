## Game Content

### Round 1: Geographic Foundation (Physical Geography)
**Clue Theme**: Mountain formation, altitude effects, glacial systems
- **Clue 1**: "Geological evidence shows recent mountain building from oceanic plate subduction beneath continental margin, creating volcanic arc systems."
- **Clue 2**: "Atmospheric data reveals extreme altitude effects with thin air, intense UV radiation, and dramatic daily temperature variation."
- **Clue 3**: "Glacial ice samples contain climate records spanning thousands of years, showing recent rapid retreat due to warming temperatures."
- **Clue 4**: "Hydrological analysis shows headwater regions of major river systems flowing to both Pacific and Atlantic ocean basins."

### Round 2: Cultural Context (Human Geography)
**Clue Theme**: High-altitude adaptation, agricultural systems, settlement patterns
- **Clue 1**: "Agricultural evidence shows sophisticated terracing systems and high-altitude crop varieties developed over millennia."
- **Clue 2**: "Settlement patterns reveal indigenous adaptation strategies for living at elevations exceeding 3,500 meters above sea level."
- **Clue 3**: "Linguistic diversity includes indigenous languages alongside colonial languages, reflecting complex cultural heritage."
- **Clue 4**: "Educational institutions specialize in high-altitude medicine, environmental engineering, and sustainable mountain development."

### Round 3: Economic & Political Systems
**Clue Theme**: Resource extraction, environmental policy, international cooperation
- **Clue 1**: "Economic indicators point to regions where mineral extraction, particularly copper and lithium, drives significant portions of national economies."
- **Clue 2**: "Political systems show democratic governments working to balance indigenous rights with resource development pressures."
- **Clue 3**: "International cooperation focuses on climate change monitoring and sustainable development in mountain regions."
- **Clue 4**: "Environmental policies address challenges of mining impact, glacier monitoring, and ecosystem preservation at extreme altitudes."

### Round 4: Specific Features & Landmarks
**Clue Theme**: Specific peaks, altiplano features, distinctive Andean locations
- **Clue 1**: "Surveillance equipment detected unauthorized research activity near Aconcagua, the highest peak in both the Western and Southern Hemispheres."
- **Clue 2**: "GPS tracking shows movement across the Altiplano, the world's second-highest plateau after Tibet, spanning multiple countries."
- **Clue 3**: "Security alerts from Machu Picchu indicate someone accessing restricted areas for unauthorized atmospheric monitoring research."
- **Clue 4**: "Final evidence trail leads to the Salar de Uyuni, the world's largest salt flat and critical habitat for flamingo species, where climate monitoring stations have been tampered with."

## Visual Specification
**Image Prompt**: "Vintage cartoon style: Environmental geologist at high-altitude research station, wearing modern mountaineering research gear with oxygen equipment and cold weather protection, holding glacial ice sampling equipment and atmospheric monitoring devices, Andean mountain background with snow-capped peaks and research instruments, warm muted palette with mountain blue, snow white, and earth tone accents, bold clean ink outlines, educational tone, dignified professional portrayal."
