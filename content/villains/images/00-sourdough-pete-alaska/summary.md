High-level visual notes (kept professional and neutral):
- Style: Vintage/retro-educational illustration style (consistent with project art direction)
- Setting cues: Alaska-themed concept; cold-weather/field-research vibe; likely outdoorsy or expedition-adjacent context
- Tools/props (assumed from theme; to be verified when descriptions are available): field notebook, map, compass, sampling kit, warm gear
- Attire: Modern, practical, cold-weather field attire (layers, boots, hat) — no cultural costume elements
- Expression/pose: Professional, focused; educator/explorer tone rather than caricature

Usage guide:
- Do not imply cultural identity from clothing; keep characterization based on professional role (expedition logistics, conservation, geography) and Alaska setting.
- Respect Note anchor: emphasize environmental stewardship, responsible exploration, and scientific curiosity.
