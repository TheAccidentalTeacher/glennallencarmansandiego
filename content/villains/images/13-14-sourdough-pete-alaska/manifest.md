# Image Manifest — Sourdough Pete (Folder: content/villains/images/00-sourdough-pete-alaska)

Purpose: Record what is visibly present in each image so we can align the character dossier precisely to the hardest-to-change assets.

Reference notes
- README visual intent (author notes): log‑cabin map room, flannel/suspenders/wool cap, world maps/globes, aurora outside, sled dogs, oil lamp, artifacts gallery.
- Existing summary (professional tone): modern field attire, expedition vibe, no cultural costume elements; neutral, non‑caricature.

Observed set summary (based on provided images)
- Outdoor sled‑dog scene under aurora: flannel shirt, suspenders, wool cap, leather gloves; several huskies pulling a sled; aurora arcs; conifer treeline; distant aircraft; energetic, cartoony tone.
- Map‑room with safe: wood‑paneled study, multiple wall maps (incl. Alaska), globe, open safe with gold bars/coins and assorted trinkets, oil lamps; canine (husky/wolf‑like) sleeping on a rug; aurora visible through a porthole‑like window.
- Gallery with skylight: display cases labeled “ARTIFACT…”, cracked glass on some covers, world map on wall with red route lines, globe with note, dog seated; large skylight shows aurora and mountain silhouettes.
- Log‑cabin study: Pete holding a compass and an aged world map; shelves with assorted figurines/masks/statues, oil lamps, globes; aurora visible through a window; warm light, cozy interior.

Alignment implications
- Attire is “frontier practical” (flannel, suspenders, wool cap): treat as functional cold‑weather layers; do not ascribe cultural identity.
- Sled dogs and aircraft appear: normal Alaska flavor. Show healthy teams, competent handling; no how‑to instruction or operational details.
- “Artifacts” appear repeatedly: treat as replicas/educational props; avoid language implying theft; keep within “reversible mischief.”
- Auroral night skies and log‑cabin interiors are recurring: incorporate into Visual Grounding and Image Prompt.

Instructions
- For each file below, fill the observations. Keep language neutral/objective. Then mark any dossier alignment impacts.

## Quick alignment checklist (to apply after observations)
- If frontier attire (flannel/suspenders/wool cap) appears:
  - Dossier note should frame attire as practical cold‑weather layers, not cultural costume.
- If sled dogs appear in background:
  - Dossier may acknowledge outdoor kennel scenes as background flavor; avoid implying risky expedition tactics.
- If “artifact gallery” is present:
  - Recast as replicas/educational props in text; avoid “stolen artifacts” to comply with Code of Mischief (reversible, no harm).
- If aurora/log cabin vibes are present:
  - Update image prompt/visual grounding to include warm map‑room with aurora and log‑cabin aesthetic.
- If classroom/lesson pose appears:
  - Emphasize Quartermaster’s “celebrate being foiled” pedagogy in Overview.

After this manifest is filled, we’ll adjust the dossier’s Visual Grounding, Overview, and Image Prompt sections to match observed elements while keeping cultural safeguards.
