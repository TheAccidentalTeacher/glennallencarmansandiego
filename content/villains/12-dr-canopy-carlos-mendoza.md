**Clue Theme**: Tropical climate, elevation gradients, forest types
- **Clue 1**: "Climate data shows tropical conditions with high temperature and humidity year-round, supporting complex multi-layered forest ecosystems."
- **Clue 2**: "Elevation profiles reveal dramatic topographic gradients creating diverse climate zones from sea level to cloud forest conditions."
- **Clue 3**: "Soil analysis indicates nutrient-poor tropical soils with rapid decomposition cycles and complex mycorrhizal networks."
- **Clue 4**: "Hydrological patterns show high annual rainfall with seasonal variation supporting both wet and dry tropical forest types."

### Round 2: Cultural Context (Human Geography)
**Clue Theme**: Indigenous forest knowledge, conservation communities, ecotourism
- **Clue 1**: "Settlement patterns show forest communities with traditional ecological knowledge about sustainable forest resource management."
- **Clue 2**: "Cultural practices include traditional forest conservation methods and indigenous classification systems for forest biodiversity."
- **Clue 3**: "Economic activities demonstrate growing emphasis on ecotourism and sustainable forest products as alternatives to deforestation."
- **Clue 4**: "Educational institutions specialize in tropical biology, conservation science, and sustainable development research and training."

### Round 3: Economic & Political Systems
**Clue Theme**: Conservation economics, international cooperation, sustainable development
- **Clue 1**: "Economic systems increasingly emphasize payments for ecosystem services, carbon credits, and sustainable forest product certification."
- **Clue 2**: "Political cooperation includes regional biodiversity conservation agreements and transboundary protected area management."
- **Clue 3**: "International development focuses on REDD+ programs, biodiversity conservation funding, and sustainable community development."
- **Clue 4**: "Government policies balance conservation needs with rural development through eco-certification and sustainable forest management programs."

### Round 4: Specific Features & Landmarks
**Clue Theme**: Biodiversity hotspots, national parks, specific forest locations
- **Clue 1**: "Bioacoustic equipment recovered from Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve, famous for its unique high-elevation tropical ecosystem."
- **Clue 2**: "Canopy research gear found in Manuel Antonio National Park, where tropical rainforest meets Pacific Ocean beaches."
- **Clue 3**: "Biodiversity monitoring devices discovered along the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor, connecting protected areas across multiple countries."
- **Clue 4**: "Final evidence trail leads to Corcovado National Park, containing 2.5% of the world's biodiversity in just 0.001% of the planet's surface area."

## Visual Specification
**Image Prompt**: "Vintage cartoon style: Tropical ecologist at rainforest research station, wearing modern field research gear with rain protection and climbing equipment, holding bioacoustic monitoring device and biodiversity survey tablet, Central American rainforest background with canopy research towers and tropical vegetation, warm muted palette with rainforest green, earth brown, and tropical flower accents, bold clean ink outlines, educational tone, dignified professional portrayal."
