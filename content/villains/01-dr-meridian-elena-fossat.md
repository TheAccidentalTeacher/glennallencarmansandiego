## Game Content

### Round 1: Geographic Foundation (Physical Geography)
**Clue Theme**: Mountain systems, elevation, climate patterns
- **Clue 1**: "Soil samples show limestone composition typical of fold mountain ranges formed by tectonic collision between continental plates."
- **Clue 2**: "Weather data indicates alpine climate with temperature inversions and orographic precipitation patterns."
- **Clue 3**: "Botanical evidence includes endemic species adapted to thin air and intense UV radiation above treeline."
- **Clue 4**: "Geological surveys reveal evidence of glacial activity and U-shaped valleys characteristic of Pleistocene ice sheets."

### Round 2: Cultural Context (Human Geography)  
**Clue Theme**: Mountain communities, languages, settlement patterns
- **Clue 1**: "Communication intercepts include multiple languages from the Romance and Germanic language families."
- **Clue 2**: "Settlement patterns show valley-bottom villages connected by mountain passes used for centuries of trade."
- **Clue 3**: "Local traditions include seasonal migration patterns between valley floors and high alpine meadows."
- **Clue 4**: "Educational institutions specialize in mountain research, including glaciology and sustainable tourism programs."

### Round 3: Economic & Political Systems
**Clue Theme**: Mountain economy, international cooperation, environmental policy
- **Clue 1**: "Economic evidence points to regions where tourism, hydroelectric power, and precision manufacturing drive the economy."
- **Clue 2**: "Political structures show federal systems with strong local autonomy for mountain communities."
- **Clue 3**: "International cooperation agreements focus on trans-boundary environmental protection and climate research."
- **Clue 4**: "Infrastructure development balances modern transportation needs with environmental conservation requirements."

### Round 4: Specific Features & Landmarks
**Clue Theme**: Famous peaks, specific locations, unique alpine features
- **Clue 1**: "Witnesses report activity near the Matterhorn, one of the most recognizable pyramid-shaped peaks in the world."
- **Clue 2**: "GPS data shows movement through the Gotthard Pass, a crucial transportation corridor through the mountains."
- **Clue 3**: "Surveillance footage from the Jungfraujoch research station shows someone accessing high-altitude climate monitoring equipment."
- **Clue 4**: "Final evidence trail leads to the Aletsch Glacier, the largest glacier system in the Alps and a UNESCO World Heritage site."

## Visual Specification
**Image Prompt**: "Vintage cartoon style: Environmental scientist in alpine research station, wearing modern mountaineering field gear and safety equipment, holding portable soil analysis device and climate monitoring tablet, Swiss Alpine background with snow-capped peaks and research equipment, warm muted palette with navy blue, forest green, and snow white accents, bold clean ink outlines, educational tone, dignified professional portrayal."

## Cultural Sensitivity Checklist
- [x] Character defined by environmental expertise, not nationality
- [x] No cultural stereotypes (no lederhosen, berets, or cultural props)
- [x] Respectful representation focused on scientific contribution
- [x] Professional field attire appropriate to mountain research
- [x] Focus on academic achievements and research excellence
- [x] Avoids harmful generalizations about European cultures
- [x] Educational value emphasizes geography and environmental science

## Implementation Data
- **Educational Tags**: ["alpine ecosystems", "mountain geography", "European physical features", "climate zones", "environmental science"]
- **Clue Templates**: Structured for progressive difficulty in mountain geography understanding
- **Difficulty Justification**: Level 3 requires knowledge of European geography, mountain formation, and alpine ecosystems without being overly complex
- **Assessment Opportunities**: Teachers can assess understanding of elevation effects, European boundaries, environmental systems, and sustainable development concepts
