## Still Need Original Homes For:
- **Dr. Mirage (Amara Benali)** - Desert specialist images (where are they?)
- **Dr. Cordillera (Isabella Mendoza)** - South American mountain images (different from Altiplano?)
- **Professor Tectonic (Jin Wei-Ming)** - Original intended seismic content (if different from Dr. Li Wei)

## Next Folders to Audit:
- Continue systematic review through folders 06-12

**World Building Day Progress:** 3/13 folders reorganized and documented

## OLD AUDIT NOTES (Now Resolved Above):

### Folder: 03-dr-mirage-amara-benali (WRONG)
**Images Found:** 5 seismic engineering images
**Actual Character:** Professor Tectonic (Jin Wei-Ming)
**Evidence:** 
- Image 5 has sign reading "MOUNT FUJI SEISMIC RESEARCH STATION - DR. LI WEI LEAD SEISMOLOGIST"
- All images show earthquake monitoring, geological surveys, seismic equipment
- Character teaches about plate tectonics, not desert systems
**Action Needed:** Move these to folder 04-professor-tectonic-jin-wei-ming

**Expected Dr. Mirage Content:** 
- Should be desert geomorphology specialist
- Oasis hydrology, sand dunes, arid climate research
- North African/Sahara geographic expertise

### Folder: 04-professor-tectonic-jin-wei-ming (WRONG)
**Images Found:** 5 high-altitude Andes research images
**Actual Character:** Dr. Altiplano (Isabella Santos)
**Evidence:**
- Image 1 text: "Dr. ALTIPLANO - DR. ISABELLA SANTOS"
- Image 4 sign: "ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING STATION - ACONCAGUA"
- All images show South American Andes, high-altitude research, glacial studies
- Character specializes in mountain/altitude geography, not seismic engineering
**Action Needed:** Move these to correct folder (05-dr-cordillera-isabella-mendoza?)

## Current Findings:
- **Seismic/Earthquake images** (Professor Tectonic content) â†’ Currently in folder 03 (Dr. Mirage)
- **Andes/High Altitude images** (Dr. Altiplano content) â†’ Currently in folder 04 (Professor Tectonic)
- Need to find: Real Dr. Mirage (desert) images, Real Professor Tectonic folder location

## Next Folders to Audit:
- Check folder 05 (Dr. Cordillera) - might have more misplaced content
- Look for desert specialist images (real Dr. Mirage)
- Find where the REAL Professor Tectonic images belong

**World Building Day Progress:** 2/13 folders audited, 2 major mismatches found
