# Content Creation Guide: Sourdough Pete

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for creating culturally sensitive, educationally valuable content for "Sourdough Pete's Geography Challenge." All content must adhere to our principles of respectful representation, educational integrity, and cultural sensitivity.

## Cultural Sensitivity Guidelines

### Core Principles

#### 1. Expertise-Based Characterization
- **Focus on Professional Skills:** Characters are defined by their expertise, not their cultural background

- **Modern Context:** Characters wear contemporary, professional attire
- **Dignified Portrayal:** All characters are intelligent, skilled professionals

#### 2. Respectful Representation
- **Cultural Inspiration, Not Stereotyping:** Draw from cultural traditions respectfully
- **Avoid Religious Symbols:** Unless pedagogically necessary and culturally appropriate
- **Neutral Terminology:** Use professional, academic language
- **Expert Review:** All cultural content must be reviewed by cultural experts

#### 3. Educational Value
- **Geographic Learning:** Every element should teach something about geography
- **Cultural Appreciation:** Foster understanding and respect for diversity
- **Historical Context:** Include appropriate historical and cultural context
- **Global Connections:** Show how places connect to the wider world

### Prohibited Content
- Cultural stereotypes or caricatures
- Religious symbols or imagery (unless specifically approved)
- Outdated or colonial terminology
- Generalizations about entire cultures or peoples
- Content that could perpetuate harmful stereotypes

## Villain Creation Guide

### Character Development Framework

#### Basic Information
```typescript
// Required fields with guidelines
interface VillainCreationGuide {
  codename: string;          // Professional, not cultural (e.g., "Dr. Meridian", "Professor Sage")
  fullName: string;          // Culturally appropriate name without stereotyping
  region: string;            // Geographic region of expertise, not ethnicity
  culturalInspiration: string; // Professional tradition, not ethnic stereotype
  respectNote: string;       // Explanation of respectful portrayal approach
}
```

#### Professional Specialties (Examples)

```

#### Economic/Political Clues (Round 3)
Focus on systems and structures:
```
Templates:
- "Economic data indicates [trade pattern] typical of [economic system]"
- "Currency evidence suggests [monetary system] used in [political region]"
- "Trade route analysis points to [commercial pattern] in [geographic area]"
- "Political structure shows [governance type] common to [regional bloc]"

Example:
"Economic analysis reveals tourism-based economy with agricultural exports, typical of Mediterranean island nations within the European economic zone."
```

#### Landmark/Specific Clues (Round 4)
Focus on unique identifiers:
```
Templates:
- "Archaeological evidence points to [historical period] ruins in [specific region]"
- "Geographic coordinates suggest [specific location] near [landmark]"
- "Environmental monitoring indicates [unique feature] found only in [location]"
- "Geological markers point to [specific formation] characteristic of [place]"

Example:
"Archaeological evidence reveals ancient Greek and Roman ruins on a strategic island position controlling Mediterranean shipping lanes, with unique limestone formations and endemic wildlife species."
```

## Case Creation Guide

### Educational Objective Mapping

#### Primary Objectives
Each case should address 2-3 primary learning objectives:
- **Physical Geography:** Landforms, climate, natural resources
- **Political Geography:** Countries, boundaries, governance systems
- **Cultural Geography:** Languages, traditions, cultural landscapes
- **Economic Geography:** Trade, resources, economic systems
- **Environmental Geography:** Ecosystems, conservation, human-environment interaction

#### Cross-Curricular Connections
- **History:** Historical events influenced by geography
- **Science:** Environmental science, climate, geology
- **Language Arts:** Vocabulary, reading comprehension, writing
- **Mathematics:** Coordinates, scale, data analysis

### Case Structure Template

#### Scenario Development
```
Title Template: "The [Adjective] [Object] [Action]"
Examples:
- "The Vanished Maritime Chart Collection"
- "The Missing Geological Survey Data"
- "The Stolen Archaeological Preservation Tools"

Scenario Template:
"[Professional documents/tools] have disappeared from [institutional setting]. 
The theft appears to be the work of someone with expertise in [professional field] 
who targets [specific type of materials] for [professional motivation]."
```

#### Round Progression Planning
```
Round 1 (Geographic Foundation): Broad geographic clues
- Physical features, climate, general location
- Regional characteristics without specific identification
- Environmental factors and natural resources

Round 2 (Cultural Context): Cultural and historical elements
- Language families and cultural traditions
- Historical influences and cultural exchange
- Respectful cultural indicators

Round 3 (Economic/Political): Systems and structures
- Economic systems and trade patterns
- Political structures and international relationships
- Currency, governance, and economic indicators

Round 4 (Landmark/Specific): Unique identifiers
- Specific landmarks and unique features
- Precise geographic indicators
- Distinctive characteristics that pinpoint location
```

### Difficulty Calibration

#### Difficulty Levels (1-5 Scale)

**Level 1 (Easy):** Elementary concepts, obvious clues
- Large, well-known countries
- Clear, direct geographic indicators
- Minimal cultural complexity
- Straightforward economic/political systems

**Level 2 (Basic):** Fundamental geography knowledge
- Medium-sized countries or major regions
- Moderately obvious clues with some inference required
- Basic cultural knowledge
- Standard economic/political systems

**Level 3 (Intermediate):** Standard middle-grade level
- Various country sizes including smaller nations
- Clues require synthesis and inference
- Cultural knowledge with respectful complexity
- Diverse economic/political systems

**Level 4 (Advanced):** Challenging for grade level
- Smaller countries or specific regions
- Clues require significant inference and background knowledge
- Complex cultural interactions and historical context
- Sophisticated economic/political understanding

**Level 5 (Expert):** Beyond standard curriculum
- Remote locations or highly specific regions
- Clues require advanced geographic reasoning
- Deep cultural and historical knowledge
- Complex international relationships and systems

#### Clue Obfuscation for High Difficulty
For levels 4-5, early round clues should be intentionally vague:
```
Instead of: "The Andes mountain range"
Use: "A major longitudinal cordillera extending along the western coast"

Instead of: "The Amazon rainforest"
Use: "The world's largest tropical rainforest ecosystem"

Instead of: "The Mediterranean Sea"
Use: "An enclosed sea bordered by three continents"
```
