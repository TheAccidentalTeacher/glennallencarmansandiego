# Lore Bible (Series Backstory Plan)

This document will define the overarching narrative for Sourdough Pete, the organization structure, and respectful, culturally sensitive dossiers for each character.

## Goals
- Provide a professional, non‑stereotyped characterization for every figure
- Ensure cultural sensitivity (with special attention to Indigenous characters like Dr. Blackfoot)
- Create connective tissue across the 12 weekly cases and the 2‑week finale

## Sections (to be authored)
1. Series Overview and Themes
2. Organization Structure (Pete’s network)
3. Character Dossiers (13 total)
   - Professional specialty and motivation
   - Respect note and cultural review notes
   - Image references (from content/villains/images)
   - Recurring hooks (calling card, signature tools)
   - See: [Dossiers Tracker](./dossiers/README.md) and dossiers: [Sourdough Pete](./dossiers/sourdough-pete.md), [Dr. Meridian](./dossiers/dr-meridian-elena-fossat.md), [Professor Sahara](./dossiers/professor-sahara-amira-hassan.md)
   - Organization Backdrop: [Sourdough Syndicate (Draft v1)](./organizations/sourdough-syndicate.md)
4. Season Arc (12 + Finale)
5. Educational Weave (how each case maps to learning goals)

This is a planning scaffold. We will fill it after Milestones 1–4 when the case engine and presentation flow are in place.
