## Content Transformation Standards

### Language Transformation
- **Graduate Level** â†’ **11-Year-Old Friendly**
- **Technical Terms** â†’ **Relatable Analogies**
- **Complex Concepts** â†’ **Step-by-Step Explanations**

#### Example Transformations:
| Graduate Level | 11-Year-Old Friendly |
|---|---|
| "Altitudinal zonation affects atmospheric pressure" | "It's hard to breathe at the top because the air is thin" |
| "Andean orogeny created the longest continental mountain chain" | "These mountains look like a long, bumpy spine running down the side of a continent" |
| "Tropical glaciation near the equatorial region" | "Ice that never melts, even though it's near the equator!" |

### Educational Scaffolding
1. **Visual Learning**: Each clue includes appropriate villain imagery
2. **Research Skills**: Progressive hints teach different investigation methods
3. **Geographic Tools**: Encourages use of globes, maps, atlases
4. **Critical Thinking**: Builds from general to specific concepts
