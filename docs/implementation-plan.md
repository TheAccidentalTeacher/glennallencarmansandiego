# Implementation Plan: Sourdough Pete's Geography Challenge

## ‚úÖ SUCCESSFUL EDUCATIONAL TRANSFORMATION COMPLETED (Oct 3, 2025)

**Status**: Phase 1 & 2 complete - Educational content transformation successful!

### Achievement Summary
- **‚úÖ Content Transformation**: Successfully converted graduate-level geography cases to 11-year-old friendly educational content
- **‚úÖ Progressive Discovery Learning**: Implemented 6-step educational flow per round
- **‚úÖ Technical Implementation**: Frontend supports clue progression, hint reveals, and educational answers
- **‚úÖ Accessibility**: Fixed button contrast and visual hierarchy issues
- **‚úÖ Pilot Cases**: 3 cases converted and tested successfully

### Validated Educational Approach
Our pilot transformation proves this content delivery method works:

1. **Dr. Altiplano's Mountain Mystery** - Mountain geography, climate, indigenous cultures
2. **Dr. Coral's Ocean Adventure** - Marine geography, tropical islands, coral reef ecosystems  
3. **Professor Atlas's Map Mystery** - European political geography, cartography, cultural boundaries

**Key Success**: Complex graduate concepts successfully transformed to engaging 11-year-old detective adventures with proper educational scaffolding.

## üìö Educational Content Standards (ACTIVE)

### Required Content Transformation Process
All new cases must follow the proven educational transformation pattern:

#### 1. **Age-Appropriate Language Conversion**
- **Graduate Level** ‚Üí **11-Year-Old Friendly**
- **Technical jargon** ‚Üí **Relatable analogies** 
- **Complex syntax** ‚Üí **Simple, clear sentences**

#### 2. **Progressive Discovery Structure (Per Round)**
```
Step 1: Reveal Detective Clue (age-appropriate mystery)
Step 2: Reveal Research Hint #1 (globe/map work)
Step 3: Reveal Research Hint #2 (alternative research method)  
Step 4: Reveal Research Hint #3 (specific investigation term)
Step 5: Reveal Educational Answer (comprehensive learning content)
Step 6: Auto-advance to next round
```

#### 3. **Required JSON Structure**
Each case must include:
- `clueHtml`: 11-year-old friendly detective narrative
- `researchPrompts`: Array of 3+ progressive research directions
- `explainHtml`: Comprehensive educational explanation with learning objectives
- `answer.name`: Clear geographic location identifier

#### 4. **Content Quality Standards**
- **Reading Level**: 6th grade vocabulary maximum
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Inclusive and respectful representations
- **Educational Value**: Clear learning objectives per round
- **Engagement**: Detective narrative maintains interest throughout

### Villain Image Integration
- All cases must map `villainId` to existing image folders
- Frontend automatically resolves: `dr-altiplano-isabella-santos` ‚Üí `04-dr-altiplano-isabella-santos`
- Images must load correctly with proper URL encoding

## Teacher‚ÄëLed MVP Plan (Sept 26, 2025)

Context: For the next few weeks this app will be used only by the teacher (Mr. Scott Somers) via HDMI on a projector as a whole‚Äëclass game. Students will not log in or use their own devices yet. The objective is to deliver a rock‚Äësolid, playable in‚Äëclass experience first, then add multi‚Äëuser/auth/database features later.

This section supersedes earlier priorities. The original plan remains below as a reference, but the order of work is now explicitly teacher‚Äëfirst and offline‚Äëfriendly.

### Product Goals (MVP)
- Play a complete, repeatable case end‚Äëto‚Äëend in front of the class using a single computer.
- Teacher controls the flow: start game, reveal clues, collect a class guess on the map, submit solution, show distance/score, advance rounds, show final results.
- No logins, no per‚Äëstudent devices, no network dependencies beyond localhost.
- Use existing filesystem content for villains and images; cases stored as simple JSON files.

### Out‚Äëof‚ÄëScope (defer until after MVP)
- Authentication, roles, and accounts
- Multi‚Äëdevice student joins and live sync
- PostgreSQL or Atlas‚Äëbacked content (use filesystem JSON for now)
- CI/CD, cloud deploy, multi‚Äëclass concurrency

---

## MVP Definition (Teacher‚ÄëOnly, Single‚ÄëMachine)

### Data and Content
- Villains: use existing images in `content/villains/images/*` (already working)
- Cases: add JSON files under `content/cases/` describing rounds, clues, answers

Example case JSON (proposed):
```json
{
  "id": "sourdough-pete-alaska-demo",
  "title": "Sourdough Pete‚Äôs Alaska Escape",
  "villainId": "sourdough-pete",
  "rounds": [
    {
      "clueHtml": "<p>He slipped north where glaciers meet the sea...</p>",
      "answer": { "name": "Juneau, Alaska, USA", "lat": 58.3019, "lng": -134.4197 },
      "explain": "Capital city accessible only by boat or plane; glacial fjords nearby."
    },
    {
      "clueHtml": "<p>Gold rush tales echo along a winding trail...</p>",
      "answer": { "name": "Skagway, Alaska, USA", "lat": 59.4583, "lng": -135.3139 },
      "explain": "Klondike Gold Rush gateway; White Pass & Yukon Route."
    }
  ],
  "solution": {
    "villainId": "sourdough-pete",
    "victim": "National Museum of Bread History",
    "item": "The Ancient Sourdough Starter"
  }
}
```

### Backend (Express) ‚Äì minimal endpoints
- GET `/api/images/villains` ‚Äì already returns villain ids
- GET `/api/cases` ‚Äì list case JSON (read from `content/cases/*.json`)
- GET `/api/cases/:id` ‚Äì fetch a single case JSON
- POST `/api/session` ‚Äì create an in‚Äëmemory session from a case
- GET `/api/session/:id` ‚Äì fetch current session state
- POST `/api/session/:id/advance` ‚Äì move to next round
- POST `/api/session/:id/guess` ‚Äì record the class‚Äôs map guess {lat, lng, label}
- POST `/api/session/:id/solution` ‚Äì submit solution (villain confirmation)
- GET `/api/session/:id/summary` ‚Äì computed totals and recap

Implementation detail:
- Store sessions in memory (a simple Map) and optionally persist snapshots to `data/sessions/{timestamp}.json` for recovery and teacher export.
- For projector/control dual views on one machine, polling (1‚Äì2s) is sufficient; WebSockets/SSE optional later.

### Frontend ‚Äì pages and responsibilities
- `/control` (Teacher Control)
  - Choose case (from `/api/cases`)
  - Start game ‚Üí creates session
  - Reveal next clue ‚Üí displays on projector view
  - Map interaction to collect a single class guess (lat/lng)
  - Submit guess ‚Üí see distance line, score, explanation
  - Advance round ‚Üí repeat until done
  - Submit solution ‚Üí final score + recap
  - Save/export session results

- `/projector` (Read‚ÄëOnly Projector View)
  - Big, clean display for the class
  - Shows current clue, map with guess vs answer, and scoreboard
  - Auto‚Äërefreshes session state (polling) every 1‚Äì2 seconds

### Scoring (use what exists, minimum rules)
- Distance‚Äëbased points per round
- Bonus/penalty hooks available later (time, accuracy tiers)
- Final score is sum of rounds; solution correctness adds a bonus

### Accessibility and Classroom Fit
- Large typography and high‚Äëcontrast colors
- Single‚Äëbutton flows, keyboard shortcuts (N for next, G for guess, W for solution)
- ‚ÄúReset Game‚Äù and ‚ÄúResume Last Session‚Äù buttons

## Collaborative Content Authoring Workflow (Teacher‚ÄëLed)

This section documents how we will co‚Äëauthor the season‚Äôs content with tight feedback loops. Each step is small, we check in, then move on.

### Step 1 ‚Äî Lock series tone and vibe
- Options to choose (can be mixed):
  - Retro‚Äëeducational, warm, clever; light humor but grounded
  - Straight academic tone, minimal humor, very factual
  - Playful adventure with tight cultural safeguards

### Step 2 ‚Äî Select primary learning focus (pick 2‚Äì3)
- Physical geography ‚Ä¢ Cultural geography ‚Ä¢ Economic systems/trade ‚Ä¢ Environmental systems ‚Ä¢ Political geography/governance

### Step 3 ‚Äî Choose difficulty arc for 12 + 2 finale
- Ramp up (early easy ‚Üí mid medium ‚Üí late hard ‚Üí finale hardest)
- Mixed each week (1‚Äì2 easy clues + 1‚Äì2 hard clues per case)
- Custom pattern

### Step 4 ‚Äî Prioritize first 3 dossiers to draft
- From the roster (rename later if desired): Sourdough Pete, Dr. Meridian, Dr. Aurora, Dr. Mirage, Professor Tectonic, Dr. Cordillera, Dr. Monsoon, Dr. Sahel, Dr. Qanat, Professor Atlas, Dr. Pacific, Dr. Watershed, Dr. Canopy

### Step 5 ‚Äî Naming policy for culturally sensitive characters
- Keep heritage‚Äësignaling names with careful bios, OR use neutral names and keep bios purely professional. State preference upfront.

### Step 6 ‚Äî Image summary approach
- We summarize image folders (setting, tools, vibes) to ground dossiers. If any images need changes, we adjust prompts before narrative writing.

### Definition of Ready (DoR)
- For a dossier: selected character + tone guidance + name policy + any must‚Äëinclude/avoid notes
- For a case: chosen region/theme + difficulty target + 2‚Äì3 learning objectives + any constraints

### Definition of Done (DoD)
- Dossier: 1‚Äì2 paragraph professional backstory; signature tools/calling card; respect note; 1 image prompt aligned to Content Guide; 4‚Äì6 educational tags; links to cultural review notes
- Case: briefing; 3‚Äì4 rounds (clueHtml + answer lat/lng + explainHtml); solution; resolution; passes cultural pre‚Äëcheck

### Cadence
- We propose ‚Üí you approve (or tweak) ‚Üí we draft small slice ‚Üí you review ‚Üí we iterate. Keep the loop to 24‚Äì48h per slice.

### Immediate Decisions Needed (from teacher)
1) Tone and vibe
2) Primary learning focus (2‚Äì3)
3) Difficulty arc
4) First 3 dossiers to draft
5) Naming policy preference
6) Green‚Äëlight to summarize images in `content/villains/images/*`

Once the 6 decisions are in, we‚Äôll draft: Series Overview + Org Structure, 3 complete dossiers, and a season arc outline, then pause for your review.

---

## Quickstart (Teacher)
1) Start servers
   - Backend starts at http://localhost:3001
   - Frontend starts at http://localhost:5173
2) Open two browser windows:
   - Window A: http://localhost:5173/control (teacher controls)
   - Window B: http://localhost:5173/projector (projector view)
3) Select case ‚Üí Start ‚Üí Reveal clue ‚Üí Collect map guess ‚Üí Submit ‚Üí Advance ‚Üí Final solution ‚Üí Recap

We‚Äôll document this in README once Milestone 3 ships.

---

## Migration Path After MVP (when ready)
1) Replace filesystem case JSON with DB‚Äëbacked storage (PostgreSQL or MongoDB) via a content import script
2) Add authentication and role‚Äëbased access for teachers
3) Introduce student join codes and multi‚Äëdevice synchronization (WebSockets/SSE)
4) Harden for deployment and multi‚Äëclass concurrency

---

> The sections below reflect the original end‚Äëto‚Äëend plan (auth + DB + sessions). Keep for reference but do not block the teacher‚Äëled MVP above.

<a id="case-design-specification-teacher-led-mode"></a>
## Case Design Specification (Teacher‚ÄëLed Mode)

This section defines how a ‚Äúcase‚Äù should look and behave for the single‚Äëmachine, teacher‚Äëcontrolled presentation flow. It distills the pattern you‚Äôve used (like the Viking/Norway example) into a structured, reusable format while allowing teacher‚Äëselected variations.

### Canonical Flow (default screens)
1) Crime Briefing (intro narrative)
2) Suspect Lineup (optional for now; can be ‚Äúvillain gallery‚Äù or simple list)
3) Investigation Rounds (typically 3‚Äì4)
   - Round 1: Geographic foundation
   - Round 2: Cultural context + first trait reveal
   - Round 3: Economic/Environmental clue + second trait
   - Round 4: Final identification + third trait
4) solution/Guess Submission (teacher enters or selects the class‚Äôs final answer)
5) Solution & Resolution (answer reveal, evidence summary)
6) Learning Extensions (follow‚Äëups, cross‚Äëcurricular)

All screens are teacher‚Äëadvanced from `/control` and displayed on `/projector`. Teachers can toggle screens on/off and reorder rounds if desired.

### Data Model (JSON, filesystem)
Minimal viable schema for MVP. Required fields marked with ‚Ä¢.

      "Science: fjords, Arctic climate",
      "Economics: oil industry impact",
      "Literature: Norse mythology"
    ]
  }
}
```

Notes:
- `clueHtml` and `explainHtml` allow rich formatting for projector readability.
- `focus` tags let us filter/analyze which domains a case covers week‚Äëto‚Äëweek.
- `scoring.distanceKmFull` is the distance where base points decay to zero (linear for MVP).

### Authoring Template (Markdown ‚Üí JSON)
Teachers can draft cases in Markdown and we‚Äôll provide a converter to JSON (optional after MVP). Template:

```markdown
# Title

## Crime Briefing
Narrative paragraph(s).

## Rounds
### Round 1 (8 min) ‚Äî Focus: Geography
- Clue: ...
- Research Prompts: ‚Ä¢ ... ‚Ä¢ ...
- Expected Process: ‚Ä¢ ... ‚Üí ...
- Trait Reveal (optional): ...
- Answer: Name (lat, lng)
- Explanation: ...

### Round 2 ...

## solution
- Expected Country: ...
- Suspect (optional): name + notes

## Resolution
- Evidence Summary (bullet list)
- Learning Extensions (bullets)
- Cross‚ÄëCurricular (bullets)
```

### UI & Controls (Teacher‚ÄëLed)
- `/control`
  - Case picker, Start Game
  - Buttons: Reveal Clue, Open Map for Guess, Submit Guess, Score & Show, Next Round, Final solution, Recap
  - Toggles: Show/Hide Suspect Lineup, Skip Round, Timer On/Off
  - Keyboard shortcuts: N (next), G (guess), W (solution), R (reveal), T (timer)
  - Timer: 8‚Äëminute default per round with pause/reset
- `/projector`
  - Large typography, limited controls
  - Shows current clue; when scoring, shows guess vs answer with distance line; final recap screen
  - Auto‚Äërefresh every 1‚Äì2s

### Validation Rules
- Case must include: id, title, briefing, ‚â•1 round, and final resolution
- Each round must include: minutes, focus[], clueHtml, answer(lat/lng/name)
- Lat ‚àà [‚Äë90, 90], Lng ‚àà [‚Äë180, 180]; minutes ‚àà [2, 20]
- Optional fields should fail softly with clear error in `/control` if missing

### Extensibility (outside the pattern)
All non‚Äëcanonical screens are teacher‚Äëselected toggles in `/control`:
- Add ‚ÄúFlag Identification Round‚Äù
- Add ‚ÄúLanguage Audio Snippet‚Äù
- Add ‚ÄúPhoto Montage‚Äù
- Add ‚ÄúMini‚ÄëQuiz‚Äù

We‚Äôll implement these as optional round types with display toggles, keeping the core JSON schema stable.

### Future: AI‚ÄëAssisted Case Generation (deferred)
When ready to connect an OpenAI (or other) key:
1) Provide a prompt template that asks the model to fill our JSON schema for a chosen region/theme/difficulty.
2) Validate the generated JSON against our schema and flag missing fields.
3) Require teacher review/edits before publishing to `content/cases/`.
4) Add a ‚ÄúGenerate Draft Case‚Äù button in `/control` with a side‚Äëby‚Äëside editor and fact‚Äëcheck tips.
5) Cache drafts on disk; never overwrite approved cases without versioning.

Safety/quality:
- Keep generation grounded by giving the model a region/topic packet (facts list, constraints, sample answers).
- Validate location lat/lng reverse‚Äëgeocoding to ensure internal consistency.
- Prefer conservative facts; allow teacher to approve/adjust before use.

<a id="villain-dossier-authoring-plan"></a>
## Villain Dossier Authoring Plan (A + C Retro‚ÄëEducational Tone)

We will author 13 character dossiers (Sourdough Pete + 12 specialists) using a tight, reviewable loop. Tone is retro‚Äëeducational and playful, with strong cultural safeguards (avoid straight academic tone).

### Difficulty Guardrail
- Aim up to ‚Äúhigh‚Äëschool sophomore with some experience,‚Äù never beyond.
- Each villain‚Äôs clue palette supports multi‚Äëcountry chases (3+ rounds) spanning geography, culture (food, dance, traditions), economy, flags, landforms (peninsulas, rivers, mesas, etc.).

### Per‚ÄëDossier Steps (one by one)
1) Image Pass (grounding)
  - Inspect folder in `content/villains/images/<slug>/`
  - Summarize setting/tools/attire without stereotypes
  - Save `summary.md` in that folder for traceability
2) Cultural Pre‚ÄëCheck
  - Run the Author‚Äôs Pre‚ÄëCheck from `docs/cultural-review-checklist.md`
  - Confirm name policy (heritage‚Äësignaling vs neutral) per teacher‚Äôs preference
3) Draft Dossier v1 (using the Dossier Template)
  - 1‚Äì2 paragraph professional backstory and motivation
  - Signature tools + calling card (professional markers only)
  - Respect Note (how portrayal stays dignified and neutral)
  - Image Prompt (aligned with Content Creation Guide)
  - 4‚Äì6 Educational Tags (e.g., Alpine Geography, Trade Routes)
4) Clue Domains & Case Seeds
  - Define 4+ clue domains the villain naturally supports (e.g., cartography ‚Üí coordinates; marine biology ‚Üí currents)
  - Propose 1‚Äì2 case seeds linking to 2‚Äì3 countries for chase rounds
5) Review & Iterate
  - Teacher feedback applied; finalize v2
6) Cultural Review & Approval
  - Record outcomes in checklist; set dossier status to approved

### Organization Dossier
- Define Sourdough Pete‚Äôs network: roles, rivalries, and collaborative patterns
- Map each specialist‚Äôs niche to likely geographies and case hooks
- Document communication motifs (non‚Äësensitive) used as in‚Äëworld breadcrumbs

### Acceptance Criteria (per dossier)
- Professional, non‚Äëstereotyped portrayal with Respect Note
- Image Prompt adheres to `docs/content-creation-guide.md`
- Educational tags and clue domains support multi‚Äëcountry chases
- Links to cultural review notes and `summary.md` photo grounding

### Tracking & Artifacts
- Tracker: `docs/dossiers/README.md` (status per villain)
- Grounding files: `content/villains/images/<slug>/summary.md`
- Final dossier lives in `docs/lore-bible.md` under Character Dossiers

<a id="alaska-two-part-research-plan"></a>
## Sourdough Pete Two‚ÄëPart Alaska Special (Copper River Valley & Glennallen)

We will create a 2‚Äëpart case focused on Alaska, specifically the Copper River Valley and Glennallen.

### Research Plan (propose, then fetch with approval)
- Candidate sources: Alaska state and education sites (parks, geography, ADF&G), regional historical/cultural pages, and reputable geography references.
- On approval, we will collect facts (rivers, salmon runs, landforms, climate, history), cite sources inline in a `research-notes.md` file, and distill into clues.

### Authoring Steps
1) Research pass with citations ‚Üí `content/cases/sourdough-pete-alaska/research-notes.md`
2) Draft 2 linked case JSONs (Week 13 & 14) with multi‚Äëround chases across Alaskan sub‚Äëregions leading to Glennallen focus
3) Classroom checks: difficulty, clarity, map practice opportunities
4) Cultural pre‚Äëcheck ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Approve

### Acceptance Criteria
- Alaska‚Äëspecific, Copper River Valley & Glennallen highlighted accurately
- Clear, respectful, educational clues supporting map practice
- Cited sources available for teacher reference

We will structure the 12 cases + 2‚Äëpart finale as a coherent arc that can be adapted into a ~30K‚Äëword classroom novella for ELA work.

### Narrative Weave
- Episode beats that carry through cases (non‚Äëviolent, educational stakes)
- Recurring motifs and callbacks to reinforce learning
- Villain crossovers to justify multi‚Äëcountry chases

### Novella Adaptation Outline
- For each case: 1‚Äì2k words prose chapter capturing clues, reasoning, and reveals
- Interstitials: short bridge scenes connecting geography lessons to character choices
- Teacher edition: annotations highlighting standards/objectives and discussion prompts

### Acceptance Criteria
- Age‚Äëappropriate tone; educationally purposeful
- Chapters map clearly to cases and reinforce geography skills
- Ready for close‚Äëread strategies (vocab, text evidence, structure)
