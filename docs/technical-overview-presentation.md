- Like having a really good editor for your writing

**JavaScript vs TypeScript:**
- **JavaScript**: "Hey computer, store this thing"
- **TypeScript**: "Hey computer, store this *number* and tell me if I accidentally try to put *text* in it"

**Why We Use It:**
- **Fewer Bugs**: Catches errors while we're coding
- **Better Teamwork**: Code is easier to understand
- **Easier Maintenance**: Changes are safer to make

**Example in Our Game:**
```typescript
// TypeScript helps us define what a "case" looks like
interface GameCase {
  title: string;        // Must be text
  difficulty: number;   // Must be a number
  clues: string[];      // Must be a list of text
}
```

## Slide 6: Node.js - JavaScript Outside the Browser
### Like Taking Your Favorite Language Everywhere

**What Is Node.js?**
- JavaScript that runs on **servers** instead of just web browsers
- Created in 2009, revolutionized web development
- Think of it as "JavaScript unleashed"

**Why This Matters:**
- **One Language**: Same language for frontend AND backend
- **Fast**: Built on Chrome's super-fast JavaScript engine
- **Popular**: Huge community and lots of tools

**What It Does in Our Game:**
- Handles student login sessions
- Serves up case files and villain data
- Manages game scoring and progress
- Connects to databases (when we add them later)

**Real-World Comparison:**
- Like having a **universal translator** that works everywhere
- Instead of learning different languages for different jobs, use one language for everything

## Slide 7: Express - The Web Server Framework
### Like a Restaurant's Kitchen System

**What Is Express?**
- A **framework** for Node.js that makes building web servers easy
- Handles requests from browsers and sends back responses
- Like having a really well-organized kitchen

**Restaurant Analogy:**
- **Customer orders** = Browser requests (`GET /api/cases`)
- **Kitchen processes** = Our server logic
- **Food delivered** = Server response (JSON data)
- **Express** = The kitchen organization system

**What It Handles:**
- **Routes**: "When someone asks for `/health`, send back server status"
- **Middleware**: "Check if user is logged in before showing game data"
- **Static Files**: "Serve up images and stylesheets"
- **API Endpoints**: "Provide data in a standard format"

**In Our Game:**
```javascript
// Express route example
app.get('/api/cases', (request, response) => {
  // Send back list of all Carmen Sandiego cases
  response.json(allCases);
});
```

## Slide 9: Nixpacks - The Auto-Builder
### Like Having a Really Smart Moving Company

**What Is Nixpacks?**
- An **automatic build system** created by Railway
- Looks at our code and figures out how to run it
- Like a smart moving company that knows how to pack everything

**What It Does:**
1. **Analyzes**: "Oh, this is a Node.js project with React"
2. **Installs**: "I need Node.js version 22 and npm"
3. **Builds**: "Run `npm install` then `npm run build`"
4. **Packages**: "Bundle everything for deployment"
5. **Runs**: "Start the server with `npm start`"

**Moving Company Analogy:**
- **Old Way**: Write detailed instructions for every single step
- **Nixpacks Way**: "Here's my stuff, you figure out the best way to move it"

**Configuration File (nixpacks.toml):**
```toml
[variables]
NODE_ENV = "production"    # "Pack for long-distance moving"

[phases.setup]
nixPkgs = ["nodejs_22"]    # "We need these tools"

[start]
cmd = "npm start"          # "Start the app this way"
```
