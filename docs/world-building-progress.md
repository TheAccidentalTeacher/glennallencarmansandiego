## Next Steps (World Building Process):

1. **Content Audit:** Go through each image folder systematically
2. **Reorganization:** Move images to correct villain folders
3. **Manifests:** Document what each villain's images actually show
4. **Syndicate Mapping:** Ensure each villain fits a division role
5. **Case Development:** Build chase scenarios using geographic expertise

## Key Insights from Pete's Images:
- **Educational Philosophy:** "Artifacts" are replicas for teaching, not stolen goods
- **Global Coordinator:** Pete plans operations from Alaskan HQ with world maps
- **Respectful Representation:** Focus on professional expertise, not cultural stereotypes
- **Adventure + Learning:** Elaborate geography lessons disguised as heists

## Questions to Track:
- Which villain images are in wrong folders?
- How do we map 13 villains to 7 Syndicate divisions?
- Should some divisions have multiple specialists?
- How do multi-location chases work for each geographic specialty?

**Last Updated:** September 27, 2025 - World Building Day
**Current Focus:** Creating manifest for Dr. Monsoon (folder 06) 
**Next Session:** Continue audit of folders 07, 09-12, then Syndicate alignment
