# Differentiation: Make It Unmistakably Ours

This document codifies how our game is inspired by classic educational adventures while being clearly distinct in mechanics, visuals, and voice.

## 12 Differentiation Pillars
1. Win condition shift: foil elegant capers via optimization/ethics, not arrests. End with Traceback debriefs.
2. Core verb: route optimization with Constraint Bands and corroborating data, not trivia‑led city chasing.
3. Teacher‑led tabletop: Control vs Projector screens; collaborative class play.
4. Data literacy first: hydrographs, climographs, timetables; every critical step requires two cross‑checks.
5. New worldbuilding: Sourdough Syndicate + specialists admiring students; no agency‑vs‑villain analogs.
6. UI metaphors: Route Cards, Cache Tokens, Aspect Disks, Climagraph/Tide dials (distinct iconography).
7. Ethical operations: reversible mischief; replicas/teaching collections; no theft tropes.
8. Visual identity: field‑manual print aesthetic; diagrams and lab/field motifs (not red trench‑coat trade dress).
9. Narrative tone: professionals + communities as competent partners; two‑way knowledge sharing.
10. Endgame loop: learning‑centric Traceback, not time‑pressure bust screens.
11. Season arc: The Great Route Audit—global, multi‑constraint optimization capstone.
12. Our lexicon: windows, benches, cross‑checks, spirals, false floors, traceback; “Route Runners” for students.

## IP Hygiene Checklist (pragmatic, non‑legal)
- Names/characters: Original names/roles/orgs; never use or parody the original’s names.
- Titles/taglines: Use Operation names and Route Audit framing; never “Where in the World…”, “warrant”, “catch”.
- Visual trade dress: Tokens/dials/field‑manual look; avoid red hat/coat silhouettes, passport‑stamp UIs.
- Audio: New motif; avoid melodic signatures reminiscent of the classic.
- Mechanics: Constraint Bands, corroboration, reversible mischief; avoid travel‑ticket time mgmt and warrant loops.
- Copy/UI language: Our lexicon only; no “Chief briefing,” “hench,” “warrant.”
- Marketing: “Inspired by classic educational adventures” (press kit only if needed); do not name the brand.
- Art/costumes: Functional field attire; no iconic detective silhouettes.
- In‑product references: None. External nominative references only if necessary, not inside the product.
- QA lint: Run a “banned terms” scan over docs/content before commits.

## Brand/Messaging Guardrails
- Candidate names: Routewrights, The Route Audit, GeoFoil, Cross‑Check, Windows & Benches, Optimize The World.
- Taglines: “Solve the world with routes, data, and ethics.” “Out‑optimize every caper.”
- Voice: Confident, playful, professional; classroom‑safe humor; no chase/cop lingo.
- Visual anchors: compass‑slice insignia; tokens/dials; field‑notebook textures.

## Allowed/Preferred Vocabulary
- Route optimization, windows, benches, constraint bands, cross‑checks, traceback, reversible, educational, tokens, dials, cards, dioramas, evidence, public vantage points, community consult.

## Prohibited Vocabulary (linted)
- where in the world, warrant, chief, gumshoe, hench, capture, arrest, red coat, red hat, trench coat, passport stamp UI

## Implementation Notes
- See scripts/check-banned-terms.mjs and .github/workflows/lint-banned-terms.yml for automated checks.
- Replace any legacy “Gumshoe Guild” with “Route Runners”.
