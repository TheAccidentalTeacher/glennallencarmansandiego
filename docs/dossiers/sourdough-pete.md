# Dossier: Sourdough Pete (Draft v2 — Aligned)

Alignment Note: This character is aligned to [The Sourdough Syndicate](../organizations/sourdough-syndicate.md). Tone: comically sinister, classroom‑safe, culturally respectful; pedagogy first.

ID (slug): sourdough-pete

Codename: Sourdough Pete (The Quartermaster)

Full Name: Peter "Pete" K. Sutton

Expertise: Master route planning, classroom‑safe caper design, expedition logistics, and field navigation

Regions of Focus: Alaska interior and coastal ranges (heartbeat); global routes across the Syndicate’s divisions (Arctic, Faultlines, Watersheds, Coasts, Deserts, Canopies, Atolls)

Motivation: Elegant constraint solving and teaching through puzzles. Pete sees geography as a living network—windows, benches, chokepoints—and wants students to out‑optimize him.

Signature Tools: Route Cards (laminated move plans), Cache Tokens (coordinate/bearing/timestamp markers), Constraint Bands (season/infrastructure/safety), Aspect Disks, Climagraph Wheel; plus practical field kit (map case, compass, GPS, insulated layers)

Calling Card: A neatly folded map corner with the Syndicate’s bread‑slice watermark and a route code + timestamp (24‑hour). Often clipped to a Constraint Band.

Respect Note: Professional and non‑stereotyped. Avoid implying cultural identity from clothing or nickname; focus on modern fieldwork practice, environmental stewardship, and scientific curiosity. See org Cultural Safeguards.

Recurring visual motifs from the set
- Warm log‑cabin map rooms: wood paneling, wall maps (incl. Alaska), globes, oil lamps
- Aurora borealis through windows/skylights; mountain silhouettes
- Practical frontier attire: flannel shirt, suspenders, wool cap; functional cold‑weather layers
- Props as educational replicas: figurines/masks/statues, coins/gold stacks framed as prop room items
- Canine companion (husky/wolf‑like) present indoors; sled‑dog team appears in outdoor scene
- Occasional distant aircraft depicted as scenic background

Educational Tags: [physical‑geography, cartography, climate, watersheds, Alaska, logistics]

Review Notes: Pending cultural pre‑check

## Overview

As the Syndicate’s Quartermaster, Pete curates the Master Route Board and signs off on Operation Cards. He speaks in windows and cross‑checks, lays out Constraint Bands with theatrical precision, and approves only capers that a well‑taught class can foil. Students decode his Route Cards, align clues with public data, and learn to celebrate being foiled and doing the foiling.

## Backstory (professional; non‑stereotyped)
- Former logistics lead on environmental surveys (glacier monitoring, salmon runs, permafrost stations)
- Recruited by the Syndicate founders after a winter season defined by elegant reroutes and exact timing
- Known for meticulous caches, fairness in puzzle design, and the dramatic “click” of the Ethics Lamp when a plan needs revision

## Skills and Tells
- Route architecture: layering constraints with Constraint Bands; designing fair Spiral sequences
- Field navigation: triangulation, bearings, whiteout procedures, route card discipline
- Environmental awareness: freeze/thaw cycles, discharge patterns, avalanche terrain traps
- Logistics: cache placement, overland vs. air/sea tradeoffs, massing and burn rates
- Tells: precise timestamps; a habit of leaving two independent Cross‑Checks for any critical decision; underlining water crossings twice on maps

## Clue Domains (teacher‑led MVP)

Physical Geography
- Glaciation and permafrost cues; reading contour lines for passes and benches
- Watersheds: tributaries, confluences, discharge trends (e.g., Copper River Basin)
- Climate and seasonality: daylight windows, winds, freeze‑up/break‑up timing

Cultural Geography
- Settlement patterns along highways and river corridors; airstrip dependencies
- Place‑name literacy and respectful use; roles of local communities and professionals

Economic/Trade Geography
- Fisheries timing (salmon runs), tourism seasonality, supply chain chokepoints
- Timetable logic, modal tradeoffs, right‑of‑way constraints (treated educationally)

## Case Seeds (org‑aligned; ready to expand)
1) Operation Braided Bread (Template B — Watershed Waltz)
- Seed: Route Card snippet with “CRB‑Δ 14:30Z”; Cache Token points to a bench; hydrograph trend rising
- Cross‑Checks: USGS discharge chart; aerial of braided channels
- Learning: braided rivers, safe crossings, Glennallen hub logistics

2) Operation Faultless Crust (Template C — Faultline Fandango)
- Seed: Aspect Disk marking lee side; slope card indicates safe pass under saturation
- Cross‑Checks: storm track map; avalanche bulletin paraphrase
- Learning: slope angle heuristics; aspect; risk‑aware pass selection

3) Operation Slack Slice (Template E — Atoll Interlude)
- Seed: Tide Tiles form a slack window; ferry schedule snippet
- Cross‑Checks: wind forecast arrows
- Learning: tides, currents, slack timing, timetable planning

4) Operation Chokepoint Shuffle (Template A)
- Seed: Port draft limit map; weight icon on Route Card
- Cross‑Checks: timetable scrap; constraint band (infrastructure) clipping the calling card
- Learning: chokepoints, modal choice, constraint‑compliant routing

## Difficulty Knobs (for teacher control)
- Map Scale: neighborhood (1:24k) → region (1:250k)
- Coordinate Systems: place names → lat/lon (DMS/decimal) → UTM
- Obliqueness: explicit landmarks → silhouettes/contour hints only
- Red Herrings: benign alternates that fail timing, elevation, or safety constraints
- Cross‑Check Density: one vs. two corroborations for each critical step

## Vintage Image Prompt (art direction aligned)
“A retro educational illustration of a modern Alaskan map‑room Quartermaster on a cold‑weather research night; warm log‑cabin interior with wall maps and globes; aurora visible through a window; practical flannel/suspenders/wool cap treated as functional layers; Route Cards, Cache Tokens, and a Constraint Band on the desk; compass in hand; respectful, non‑caricature; clean line art with muted, print‑era palette; safety‑conscious tone. Props (figurines/coins) are clearly replicas in a teaching collection.”

Alternate cover art prompt (optional)
“Outdoor sled‑dog scene under aurora with a cartoony action vibe; Pete in functional cold‑weather layers on a sled, dog team in good condition, distant aircraft only as scenic background; include curved snow tracks as a playful visual; no operational details; respectful, competent tone.”

## Sources and References (to be cited in case text)
- USGS topographic maps (public domain)
- NOAA/NWS climate and river data
- Alaska DOT route and ferry timetables (publicly available info)
- Local visitor bureau maps for orientation; avoid sensitive or restricted data

## Safety Notes for Authors
- Do not glamorize hazardous travel; frame risk with mitigation and alternatives
- Do not ascribe cultural identity based on attire or nickname; keep portrayal professional
- Use Indigenous place names respectfully and accurately; avoid stereotyping or token references
- When depicting infrastructure, avoid security‑sensitive details; focus on public educational content
- Use the Ethics Lamp (review) whenever ambiguity could invite unsafe imitation; provide safer alternates
 - Sled dogs: a normal part of Alaska life. Show healthy, well‑cared teams and competent handling; no step‑by‑step expedition instruction.
 - Aircraft/vehicles: scenic background only; no operational guidance or procedures.
 - Artifacts/treasures: always describe as replicas/educational props curated by the Archivist; avoid tropes of theft or cultural exploitation.

This aligned draft is ready for cultural pre‑check and classroom tone review. After approval, we’ll wire “Operation Braided Bread” into the Copper River/Glennallen two‑part case.
