## Visual Grounding
- Alpine monitoring tripods with sensors and small solar panels
- Handheld datalogger/field analyzer and calibration cylinder; dashboard readouts in lab
- Drone present as survey flavor (no how‑to or operational steps)
- UNESCO/heritage signage at a public alpine monitoring site (respectful framing)
- Community/classroom diorama talks with terrain models and charts
- Lab‑to‑field cross‑checks (compare bench readings to field measurements)
- Braided/proglacial rivers, contour‑rich valleys, and market‑square topo‑map consults

## Signature Tools (visual prompts only)
- Handheld datalogger/field analyzer
- Calibration cylinder and probe leads
- Solar‑powered weather/atmospheric stations on tripods
- Survey drone (visual flavor only; no operation details)
- Large topographic maps with contour index and legend
- Diorama models: terrain + energy siting models for classroom/community use

## Case Seeds (teacher‑led)
1) Alpine discharge timing and cross‑checks: Students reconcile hydrograph timing with temperature and recent snowfall to optimize observation windows for a reversible caper in the upper valley.
2) Braided river crossings under rising stage: Using contour literacy and braided channel behavior, students propose safe, reversible routing choices to foil a flashy stunt without closing trails.
3) Heritage viewpoint logistics (public info only): Given crowd patterns and posted site maps, students time a public demo at a heritage viewpoint to be educational, legal, and boring to exploiters.

## Safety and Care Notes
- Drones and heritage sites are depicted as professional research flavor. Do not include operational how‑to; emphasize compliance with local rules and public contexts.
- Community scenes are two‑way knowledge sharing; portray locals as competent partners.
- Keep language natural and kind; avoid caricature or exoticism.
