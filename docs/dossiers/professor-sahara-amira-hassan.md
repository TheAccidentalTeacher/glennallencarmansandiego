## Visual Grounding
- Oases irrigation (falaj/qanat‑style channels), gridded fields, wind‑tower towns
- Hydrology models and charts; institute/lecture scenes with basin maps
- Respectful heritage surveying with GPS/total station; tripod setups in public contexts
- Archaeological documentation (brushes, bags, camera + solar sensor kit)
- Geophysics in trench: GPR pack + antenna, tablet/datalogger

## Signature Tools (visual prompts only)
- Handheld GPS/datalogger; total station on tripod; base unit
- GPR pack with antenna; tablet for readings
- Camera on tripod; compact solar sensor kit; anemometer
- Tabletop models: qanat, cistern, irrigation gates

## Case Seeds (teacher‑led)
1) Optimize oasis grid water management: Students simulate gate timings and conveyance losses to schedule a reversible stunt that teaches flow budgeting without touching real systems.
2) Heritage‑site routing via public viewpoints: Using posted maps and visitor flows, students plan a camera‑only demonstration route that stays in public vantage points and avoids implication of access.
3) Desert basin flow and settlement patterns: Compare dune winds, basin gradients, and qanat alignments to time movements safely between shade/wind corridors in a teaching caper.

## Safety and Care Notes
- Heritage work requires permissions; portray only public, respectful contexts; no operational how‑to for survey/GPR.
- Avoid extraction framing; emphasize documentation, local authority, and reversible, educational objectives.
- Keep tone natural and kind; professional field attire; no caricature.
