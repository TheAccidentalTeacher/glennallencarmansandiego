# Scene Draft Template (Beat → Prose)
Use this template to expand each 9-beat chapter structure into consistent, student-friendly prose while preserving pedagogical intent.

## 1. Chapter Metadata
- Chapter Title:
- Case / Domain:
- Target Word Count Range: (e.g. 1600–1900)
- Core Concept KB(s): (list IDs)
- Ethical Axis Focus:

## 2. Beat Expansion Blocks
For each beat, maintain roughly 150–250 words (adjust for pacing) and ensure concept clarity precedes abstraction.

### Beat 1 (LOG – Hook)
Purpose: State anomaly succinctly; plant emotional tone.
Notes: Include concrete sensory anchor or data figure.
Draft:

### Beat 2 (SCN – Field Sensory)
Purpose: Embody environment; selective vivid details supporting later reasoning.
Draft:

### Beat 3 (SCN – Data Triage / Fork)
Purpose: Compare at least two data sources; show reasoning path.
Draft:

### Beat 4 (KB – Concept Injection)
Format: Term, plain-language definition, memory hook.
Draft (concise, <80 words):

### Beat 5 (ETH – Micro-Debate)
Structure: Present dilemma → two plausible stances → narrator / cadet reflective resolution.
Draft:

### Beat 6 (SCN – Escalation / Twist)
Purpose: Shift stakes, introduce complexity or time pressure.
Draft:

### Beat 7 (SYN – Pattern Board Update)
Purpose: Explicitly reference what new piece changes in global understanding.
Draft:

### Beat 8 (SCN / INT – Partial Insight)
Purpose: Progress without full resolution; maintain forward momentum.
Draft:

### Beat 9 (TRN – Forward Foreshadow Tag)
Purpose: Tease next chapter’s domain or unresolved variable.
Draft:

## 3. Consistency Checklist (Tick before finalizing)
- [ ] Hook anomaly stated in one sentence, domain-specific.
- [ ] Sensory beat includes ≥2 senses, zero extraneous adjectives.
- [ ] Data triage compares at least two sources (instrument vs historic, etc.).
- [ ] KB uses age-appropriate vocabulary (grade-level check pending tooling).
- [ ] Ethical debate presents balanced rationale before resolution.
- [ ] Escalation changes either stakes, time, or information completeness.
- [ ] Synthesis references pattern board explicitly.
- [ ] Partial insight leaves at least one open question.
- [ ] Transition clearly signals next domain or motif.

## 4. Tone & Style Guardrails
- Readability target: Middle-school; avoid multi-clause sentences > 22 words.
- Prefer concrete nouns before abstractions (e.g., “snow layer” before “hydrologic input”).
- Maintain narrator credibility without omniscient spoilers.
- Keep ethical stance summaries constructive, not moralizing.

## 5. Adaptation Notes
If trimming length for workbook edition:
- Compress Beats 2 & 6 first (sensory + escalation) while preserving KB & ETH completeness.
- Replace descriptive lists with single vivid composite images.
