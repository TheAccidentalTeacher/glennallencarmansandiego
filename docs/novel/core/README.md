# Core Narrative Files

This folder is a simplified entry point. If everything else feels overwhelming, start here.

## Files
- `NOVEL-MASTER.md` — Canonical one-file blueprint (beats, KBs, motifs, continuity, charter, style). READ/EDIT this for content changes.
- `NOVEL-CREATOR-GUIDE.md` — How to produce prose: workflow, guardrails, automation roadmap.
- `NOVEL-EDU-OPS.md` — Instructional & classroom alignment: objectives, assessment patterns, pacing.

## How To Use (Fast Path)
1. Read Section 1–7 of `NOVEL-MASTER.md` to understand scope.
2. Open `NOVEL-CREATOR-GUIDE.md` → follow Production Workflow (Section 2) for a chapter.
3. When preparing classroom materials, pull objectives & KB IDs from `NOVEL-EDU-OPS.md` Table 1.

## Editing Policy
- Add or change Knowledge Boxes ONLY in `NOVEL-MASTER.md` Section 5, then reflect any pedagogical adjustments in `NOVEL-EDU-OPS.md`.
- DO NOT modify deprecated legacy files at `docs/novel` root—those carry headers marking them read-only.

## Version Tags
- v1.0: Initial consolidation (2025-10-07).
- Increment minor version when adding/removing KB or altering beat order.

## Questions To Ask Before Editing
- Does this change shift a concept’s reinforcement count below 2? If yes, add a replacement touchpoint.
- Does an ethics debate still map to at least one Charter Principle? If no, revise stance synthesis.
