# Character & Entity Glossary (Season 1)

## 1. Protagonist Ensemble (Atlas Corps Cadets)
| Role Archetype | Function | Narrative Voice Notes |
|----------------|----------|----------------------|
| **Lead Cadet** | Systems synthesis POV lens | Primary decision maker; integrative thinking; reader identification anchor |
| **Field Ecologist** | Environmental sensory anchor | Biodiversity expertise; acute observational skills; grounds abstract concepts |
| **Data Ethicist** | Normative challenge injector | Questions assumptions; frames ethical dilemmas; moral reasoning guide |
| **Geo-Engineer** | Infrastructure feasibility analyst | Technical modeling; infrastructure assessment; practical constraints voice |
| **Cultural Liaison** | Heritage & community mediator | Language skills; cultural sensitivity; stakeholder representation |

Usage Note: Maintain ensemble dynamics without individual names to support reader self-insertion and classroom role-play flexibility.

## 3. Institutional Entities
| Entity | Role | Characteristics |
|--------|------|-----------------|
| **Atlas Control** | Mission coordination hub | Omniscient-friendly narrator; mission log provider; ethical frame setter |
| **Atlas Corps** | Cadet training organization | Charter: Learn → Investigate → Integrate → Steward |
| **Global Data Partition** | Background crisis context | Funding freeze aftermath; network fragmentation catalyst |
| **Anomaly Ring Network** | Primary antagonistic force | Coordinated data manipulation; identity layered; maintains post-charter ambiguity |

## 4. Recurring Motifs & Artifacts
| Motif | First Appearance | Evolution | Symbolic Function |
|-------|------------------|-----------|------------------|
| **Broken Ring** | Intro (13 dark nodes) | → Arc completion (Ch14) → Spiral (Ch15) | Unresolved pattern → closure → expansion |
| **Pattern Board** | Intro (visual wall) | → Synthesis Grid (Ch8) → Mosaic (Ch14) | Investigation tool → integration method → knowledge artifact |
| **Quiet Data** | Ch5 (reef silence) | → Layer gaps (Ch9) → Sensor damping (Ch12) | Absence as signal → selective suppression → intentional masking |
| **Uncertainty Bands** | Ch3 (statistical visual) | → Monsoon timing (Ch6) → Forecast ethics (Ch13) | Scientific literacy → applied reasoning → risk communication |
| **Layered Maps** | Intro (wall display) | → Physical/Political (Ch4) → Heritage/Subsurface (Ch10-11) → Charter taxonomy (Ch15) | Complexity representation → analytical framework → governance tool |

## 5. Tone & Voice Guidelines
| Context | Narrative Approach | Vocabulary Level | Sentence Structure |
|---------|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Mission Logs** | Formal, systematic | Technical but accessible | Declarative, clear |
| **Field Scenes** | Sensory, immediate | Concrete, vivid | Varied length, immersive |
| **Knowledge Boxes** | Instructional, precise | Grade-appropriate | Simple, definitive |
| **Ethical Debates** | Balanced, reflective | Nuanced, fair | Parallel structure for options |
| **Synthesis Moments** | Integrative, satisfying | Progressive complexity | Building toward insight |

## 6. Dialogue Tags & Attribution
Since individual names are avoided, use:
- **Role-based attribution**: "the field ecologist noted," "the data ethicist questioned"
- **Collective attribution**: "the team agreed," "cadets debated"
- **Specialist attribution**: "Dr. Coral explained," "Professor Atlas defended"
- **Institutional attribution**: "Atlas Control advised," "mission logs confirmed"

---

## 7. Knowledge Box Formatting Standards
**Template Structure:**
```
**Term:** [Concept Name]
**Definition:** [Plain-language explanation in 1-2 sentences]
**Memory Hook:** [Mnemonic or visual cue, if applicable]
**Application:** [How it connects to current mission context]
```

**Style Requirements:**
- Avoid jargon without definition
- Include metric and imperial units where relevant
- Provide concrete examples before abstractions
- Maximum 80 words per Knowledge Box

---

## 8. Ethical Stance Resolution Pattern
1. **Present Dilemma:** Frame competing values clearly
2. **Explore Positions:** Give fair representation to multiple approaches  
3. **Consider Consequences:** Project likely outcomes of each choice
4. **Narrator Synthesis:** Provide reasoned stance without preaching
5. **Forward Application:** Connect resolution to broader governance principles

---

## 9. Consistency Reminders
- **Atlas Corps Identity:** Always frame as educational, collaborative, stewardship-focused (not surveillance or enforcement)
- **Specialist Motivations:** Maintain protective/professional reasons for data caution (not villainous intent)
- **Technology Plausibility:** Keep sensor networks, data analysis tools at realistic current tech level
- **Educational Balance:** Pair every abstract concept with concrete, relatable analogy
- **Future Openness:** Preserve narrative expansion possibilities (spiral motif, broader networks, seasonal structure)
