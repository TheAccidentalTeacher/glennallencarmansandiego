# Chapter 14 Beat Sheet (Draft 1): "Mosaic Assembly" (Synthesis)
Purpose: Integrate all anomaly classes; drive determination phase; prepare governance framing before finale.

| # | Type | Title / Focus | Content Summary (No Prose) | Pedagogy | Output | Continuity / Notes |
|---|------|---------------|----------------------------|----------|--------|--------------------|
|1|LOG|Hook: Near-Complete Pattern| Updated board shows 12 confirmed anomaly nodes forming 80% arc; 1 suspected, 2 unverified silence gaps remain. | Pattern recognition | Determined focus | Stakes escalate toward closure |
|2|SCN|Cross-Domain War Room| Cadet rotates layered displays (reef acoustics, timing conflicts, GPS spoof, forgery, layer gap, permit audit, airflow corridor, thermal paradox, leak node). | Comparative synthesis | Systems literacy | Visual motif culmination |
|3|SCN|Data Harmonization Pass| Resolve schema differences (temporal granularity, spatial resolution) to align anomalies temporally. | Data integration | Technical competence | Bridges to charter standards |
|4|KB|Layered Pattern Taxonomy| Defines anomaly categories: Absence, Conflict, Clone, Forgery, Selective Layer Gap, Administrative, Physical Process, Paradox, Information Hazard. | Classification | Concept consolidation | Preps educational recap value |
|5|ETH|Disclosure Strategy Debate| Reveal incomplete ring now (transparency) vs hold for final node confirmation (prevent speculation). | Governance ethics | Responsible decision model | Sets up charter principle alignment |
|6|SCN|Escalation: Silent Node Ping| A previously dark sensor briefly pings with legacy protocol signature then dropsâ€”suggests controlled reveal by adversary. | Signal forensics | Heightened urgency | Motivates rapid consolidation |
|7|SYN|Mosaic Lock-In Attempt| Cadet overlays all anomaly types onto geospatial-temporal grid; identifies predictive gap (likely polar corridor). | Predictive synthesis | Insight satisfaction | Foreshadows finale discovery |
|8|SCN|Partial Insight| Realize adversary exploiting maintenance funding gaps sequence as timing scaffold. | Meta-pattern reasoning | Strategic clarity | Connects back to Global Data Partition cause |
|9|TRN|Forward Tag| Prepare northern expedition to validate corridor & formalize charter clauses. | Transition | Anticipatory resolve | Bridges to Finale (Ch15) |

Success Criteria: All anomaly modalities surfaced; classification KB provides recap; escalation without finale revelations; direct handoff to governance conclusion.
