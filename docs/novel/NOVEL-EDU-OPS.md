# Atlas Corps Season 1 — Educational & Operations Companion

Purpose: Condensed, human-readable reference for instructional design alignment, assessment mapping, pacing, and implementation logistics distinct from narrative craft concerns. Use alongside `NOVEL-MASTER.md`.

## 2. Spaced Reinforcement Design
- Core physical geography (terrain, hydrology) introduced early → recontextualized mid-season (qanat, geothermal) → integrated classification (Ch14).
- Uncertainty appears in Ch3 (intro), operationalized Ch6 (timing), applied to risk comms Ch13, codified in Charter (Ch15).
- Ethics escalate from tactical (triage, intervention) to strategic (allocation, governance codification).

## 3. Assessment Item Blueprint (Per Chapter)
Format Recommendation: 5 formative items (2 recall / 2 application / 1 transfer). Example Patterns:
- Recall: Define term from KB.
- Application: Given scenario fragment, pick correct reasoning step.
- Transfer: Apply earlier concept to new domain (e.g., use uncertainty logic in hazard context).

## 4. Reflection Prompt Patterns
Use two per week:
1. Recap Prompt ("Explain how [KB term] influenced today’s decision about ____.")
2. Transfer Prompt ("Compare today’s anomaly with the earlier [previous chapter motif]; what analytical step was similar?")
Maintain consistent scaffolding verbs: explain, compare, predict, justify.

## 5. Pacing & Cognitive Load Safeguards
- Limit to one new primary KB per chapter; secondary concept references must anchor to prior KB ID.
- If a chapter feels heavy (e.g., Ch14), pre-distribute taxonomy preview as optional advanced handout.
- Avoid introducing fresh ethical axis during Ch15 (finale cognitive integration focus).

## 6. Data Artifact Suggestions (Optional Enhancements)
| Artifact | Chapter Tie | Usage |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Simplified Snowpack Core Profile | 2 | Visual for relief discussion |
| Albedo vs Melt Timing Mini Chart | 3 | Uncertainty interpretation practice |
| Acoustic Waveform Before/After | 5 | Quiet Data visualization |
| Multi-Source Onset Table | 6 | Source validation exercise |
| GPS Coordinate Integrity Log | 7 | Spoof detection activity |
| Hash Comparison Snippet | 8 | Forgery identification |
| Layered Species Count Grid | 9 | Stratification mapping |
| Permit Process Flowchart | 10 | Governance sequence recall |
| Ventilation Gradient Diagram | 11 | Subsurface engineering illustration |
| Thermal vs Seismic Dual Plot | 12 | Paradox analysis |
| Leak vs Corrected Index Overlay | 13 | Risk communication critique |
| Anomaly Taxonomy Matrix | 14 | Classification drill |
| Charter Draft Outline Sheet | 15 | Principle alignment mapping |

## 7. Classroom Implementation Models
Model A (Standard Weekly): 1 session narrative (15m read) + 10m KB discussion + 15m activity + 5m reflection.
Model B (Block): Pair two contiguous chapters (e.g., 10 & 11) → comparative ethics workshop.
Model C (Project-Based): Students maintain personal synthesis grid updated after each chapter.

## 8. Differentiation Strategies
- Pre-Teach Option: Provide KB preview for learners needing advance organizers.
- Extension: Ask advanced learners to identify potential missing anomaly category before Ch14 taxonomy reveal.
- Support: Offer sentence stems for ethical debate participation ("One risk of X is..." / "A benefit of Y could be...").

## 9. Integrity & Authenticity Safeguards
- Maintain realistic data ranges; flag any fictional placeholder needing domain validation before classroom use.
- Ensure all examples avoid culturally sensitive site specifics unless vetted.
- Charter principles must remain neutral & adaptable (avoid region-specific policy mandates).

## 10. Monitoring & Feedback Loop
Collect teacher feedback on:
- KB clarity (Likert 1–5)
- Cognitive load (per chapter)
- Engagement of ethics debate (qualitative)
Use simple form; iterate after first implementation cycle for v1.1 adjustments in master.

## 11. Minimal Analytics Schema (If Instrumented)
| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| chapter_id | int | 0 Intro – 15 Finale |
| kb_quiz_score | int | 0–5 formative items |
| reflection_tokens | int | Word count of reflections |
| motif_mentions | int | Count of recognized motif references |
| ethics_position_count | int | Distinct positions articulated |
| grid_update_accuracy | float | % alignment with canonical taxonomy |

## 12. Change Management Protocol
Any proposed alteration to KB order or ethics sequence must:
1. Identify downstream dependency (list chapters affected).
2. Provide pedagogical rationale.
3. Simulate reinforcement coverage table post-change.
4. Gain approval (document decision in master Versioning Notes).

## 13. Quick Reference (One-Liners)
- Core Arc: Detect → Differentiate → Classify → Codify.
- Emotional Pivot: Leak (Ch13) enables determination surge.
- Final Deliverable: Charter with audit traceability principle emphasis.

## 14. Future Educational Enhancements (Backlog)
- Adaptive quiz generator keyed to KB IDs.
- Visual motif timeline infographic.
- Student-facing simplified charter co-creation worksheet.

## 15. License & Attribution Guidance
Encourage CC-BY for educational redistribution of KB + charter framework; narrative prose may retain more restrictive license pending publication strategy.
