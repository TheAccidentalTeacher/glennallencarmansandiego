# Continuity & Plot Hole Analysis (Season 1 Narrative Backbone)

Updated for 1:1 mapping: Intro + 15 Case Chapters (Sahara Heritage & Qanat Engineering separated) + Epilogue.

## 1. Scope & Method
Sources analyzed: current case JSON set (Altiplano, Meridian, Atlas, Coral, Monsoon, Sahel, Watershed, Canopy, Sahara, Qanat, Pacific, Tectonic, Alaska demo), existing beat sheets (Intro–9), revised story bible outline, archived merge notes. Method: classify risks → remediation with chapter anchors.
Severity: (H) High, (M) Moderate, (L) Low.

## 9. Action Checklist (Revised)
1. Add drone relay line (Intro or Ch2).
2. Draft Chapter 10 beat sheet (Sahara Heritage + Permit Governance KB).
3. Draft Chapter 11 beat sheet (Qanat Engineering + immersion INT).
4. Draft Chapter 12 geothermal skeleton (distinct lens from tectonic).
5. Draft Chapter 13 tectonic leak beat sheet (emotional trough + uncertainty reuse).
6. Draft Chapter 14 synthesis consolidation beats.
7. Draft Chapter 15 finale charter + spiral hook.
8. Compile Knowledge Box master index.

## 10. Summary
Structural stability achieved via diversified hooks, separated desert chapters, and preserved synthesis → finale breathing room. Emotional trough fixed at Ch13 (tectonic leak) enabling determination rebound. Pedagogical reinforcement ensures each key concept appears at least twice. Ready to proceed with Chapters 10 & 11 beat drafting.
