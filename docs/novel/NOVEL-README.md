# Atlas Corps Season 1 Narrative Package

This folder contains the structured narrative scaffolding for the companion novel that mirrors weekly game play: Intro + 15 case-aligned chapters + Epilogue. All files are outline / beats only (no final prose) to support curriculum authoring, adaptive exports, and iterative revision.

## Quick Start (Simplified)
If this directory feels overwhelming, open `core/README.md` for the three essential consolidated files.

## 1. Reading / Release Order
Intro → Ch2 Altiplano → Ch3 Meridian → Ch4 Atlas → Ch5 Coral → Ch6 Monsoon → Ch7 Sahel → Ch8 Watershed → Ch9 Canopy → Ch10 Sahara Heritage → Ch11 Qanat Engineering → Ch12 Pacific → Ch13 Tectonic → Ch14 Synthesis → Ch15 Finale → Epilogue.

## 2. Core Files
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| STORY-BIBLE-OUTLINE.md | High-level premise, chapter thumbnails, motifs, ethical axes. |
| CONTINUITY-ANALYSIS.md | Structural / logic audit & remediation plan. |
| BEAT-SHEETS-INTRO-TO-CH4.md | Detailed beats for Intro–Chapter 4. |
| BEAT-SHEETS-CH5-CH8.md | Beats for Coral → Watershed. |
| BEAT-SHEET-CH9-DRAFT.md | Rainforest canopy layer anomaly beats. |
| BEAT-SHEET-CH10-SAHARA-HERITAGE.md | Heritage governance focus. |
| BEAT-SHEET-CH11-QANAT-ENGINEERING.md | Subsurface engineering & equity. |
| BEAT-SHEET-CH12-PACIFIC-GEOTHERMAL.md | Geothermal paradox beats. |
| BEAT-SHEET-CH13-TECTONIC-URBAN-RISK.md | Urban risk + data leak trough. |
| BEAT-SHEET-CH14-SYNTHESIS.md | Cross-case mosaic integration. |
| BEAT-SHEET-CH15-FINALE.md | Charter ratification + spiral motif. |
| KNOWLEDGE-BOX-MASTER-INDEX.md | Pedagogical KB inventory & reinforcement map. |
| EDUCATOR-ALIGNMENT.md | Chapter → objectives → KB → assessment mapping. |
| SCENE-DRAFT-TEMPLATE.md | Template for converting beats to prose. |
| CHARACTER-GLOSSARY.md | Roles, specialists, motifs, voice guidelines. |
| SAHARA-QANAT-MERGE-NOTES.md | Archived (deprecated) merge concept rationale. |
| NOVEL-README.md | This index. |

## 3. Pedagogical Spine
- Concept Spacing: Each high-value concept (elevation, uncertainty, governance, ethics) appears ≥2 times.
- Motif Progression: Broken ring → layered anomalies → predictive mosaic → spiral.
- Ethics Arc: Data integrity → timing risk → access control → allocation → transparency vs panic → governance codification.

## 4. Using These Files
1. Weekly Release: Publish one beat sheet with simplified KB and 1–2 reflection questions.
2. Prose Drafting: Use SCENE-DRAFT-TEMPLATE.md (see forthcoming) to expand each 9-beat structure.
3. Assessment Authoring: Pull KB IDs from master index to auto-generate question banks.
4. Versioning: Update continuity doc first before altering multiple downstream chapters.

## 5. Hook Taxonomy (Quick Reference)
Absence (Reef) • Conflict (Monsoon) • Clone (Sahel) • Forgery (Watershed) • Selective Layer Gap (Canopy) • Administrative (Sahara) • Physical Process (Qanat) • Paradox (Pacific) • Information Hazard (Tectonic) • Synthesis Escalation (Ch14) • Future Hook (Finale).

## 6. Future Additions (Optional)
- Character voice glossary
- Iconography style guide
- Data artifact samples (hash diff, acoustic spectrogram snippet)
