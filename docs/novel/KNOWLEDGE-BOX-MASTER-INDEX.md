# Knowledge Box Master Index (Season 1)
Purpose: Central reference for all pedagogical Knowledge Boxes (KB). Tracks introduction chapter, reinforcement points, and application usage.

| ID | Title | Core Definition / Focus | Introduced (Ch) | Reinforcement Ch(s) | Advanced Application | Notes |
|----|-------|-------------------------|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------|-------|
| KB-01 | Knowledge Cycle | Observation → Question → Concept → Application | Intro | Implicit every mission log | Synthesis (Ch14 classification) | Framing cycle, not repeated verbatim |

| KB-03 | Orographic Effect | Moist air rises, cools, precipitates windward; leeward drier | 2 (diagram) | 3 (snowpack moisture tie) | 6 (monsoon wind shift reasoning) | Visual mnemonic “Up, cool, drop.” |
| KB-04 | Snowpack & Water Storage | Snowpack as temporary water reservoir feeding rivers | 3 | 8 (watershed integration reference) | 11 (qanat cooling comparison) | Links mountains → water systems |

| KB-08 | Reef Soundscape Functions | Acoustic cues (feeding, recruitment, territory) as health proxy | 5 | 9 (canopy vertical acoustic analogy) | 14 (anomaly taxonomy) | Quiet Data motif anchor |
| KB-09 | Monsoon Onset Indicators | Humidity persistence, wind reversal, temp threshold | 6 | 8 (hydrologic timing interplay) | 13 (timing vs leak risk narrative) | Reinforces temporal reasoning |
| KB-10 | Migration Corridor Basics | Seasonal movement pathways; bottlenecks; drivers | 7 | 10 (historic corridor to heritage) | 14 (pattern mosaic cross-link) | Supports access control ethics |
| KB-11 | Catchment Hierarchy | Basin → Sub-basin → Tributary; drainage divides | 8 | 11 (overlay with qanat corridor) | 14 (synthesis classification) | Structural hydrology schema |
| KB-12 | Rainforest Stratification | Forest floor, understory, mid-canopy, emergent niches | 9 | 14 (layer taxonomy mapping) | 15 (spiral analogy to vertical layering) | Extends layering motif |
| KB-13 | Permit Governance | Multi-layer approval workflow, renewal triggers | 10 | 15 (charter clause reference) | 15 (policy codification) | Governance literacy |
| KB-14 | Qanat Engineering | Gravity flow, ventilation shafts, sustainable draw | 11 | 12 (geothermal conduit comparison) | 14 (pattern classification analogy) | Subsurface system engineering |
| KB-15 | Geothermal System Basics | Heat source, fluid circulation, vent expression | 12 | 13 (urban risk reliability compare) | 14 (hazard taxonomy) | Hazard literacy |
| KB-16 | Seismic Forecast Uncertainty | Probability ranges vs deterministic misinterpretation | 13 | 14 (classification link) | 15 (charter risk communication principle) | Reinforces uncertainty normalization |
| KB-17 | Layered Pattern Taxonomy | Anomaly category schema (Absence, Conflict, etc.) | 14 | 15 (charter rationale) | — | Capstone classification KB |
| KB-18 | Charter Principles | Five governance tenets (Raw Preservation, etc.) | 15 | — | Epilogue (future application) | Culminates ethics arc |
| KB-19 | Data Integrity Forensics | Hash/checksum comparison to detect duplication, spoof, tamper | 8 (log forgery context) | 13 (leak + masked outage) | 14 (pattern classification reference) | Make cryptographic terms age-appropriate |

## Concept Reinforcement Coverage Summary
- Every core system concept (terrain, hydrology, climate timing, ecology, governance, hazard, uncertainty) has ≥2 touches.
- Progressive abstraction: concrete (elevation, snowpack) → relational (catchments, corridors) → meta (pattern taxonomy, charter principles).

## Gaps / Optional Additions
| Potential KB | Rationale | Placement Option |
|--------------|----------|------------------|
| Acoustic vs Thermal Signals | Compare energy vs biological indicators | Ch12 pre-KB add-on line |
| (Filled) Data Integrity Forensics | Now defined (KB-19) | — |
| Acoustic vs Thermal Signals | Compare energy vs biological indicators | Ch12 pre-KB add-on line |

## Usage Guidance
- When generating weekly student materials, pair each chapter’s KB with 1 recap prompt + 1 transfer prompt (apply concept to prior chapter context).
- Avoid introducing new KBs in finale beyond Charter (cognitive load protection).
