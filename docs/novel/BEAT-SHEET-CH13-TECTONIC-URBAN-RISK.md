# Chapter 13 Beat Sheet (Draft 1): "Signal Fracture" (Urban Tectonic Risk)
Purpose: Deliver emotional trough via partial failure (data leak), reuse uncertainty concept, highlight infrastructure risk ethics.

| # | Type | Title / Focus | Content Summary (No Prose) | Pedagogy | Output | Continuity / Notes |
|---|------|---------------|----------------------------|----------|--------|--------------------|
|1|LOG|Hook: Data Leak Alert| Partial building risk index posted publicly before validation; local panic uptick on social feeds. | Data governance | Immediate tension | Information hazard hook |
|2|SCN|Urban Sensor Walk| Cadet surveys structural health sensors (tilt, vibration) across mixed building ages; notes variance patterns. | Infrastructure monitoring | Concrete system sense | Different environment from geothermal field |
|3|SCN|Uncertainty Overlay| Apply uncertainty bands to risk index; shows leaked values omit confidence intervals. | Statistical literacy | Critical evaluation | Repetition of uncertainty pedagogy |
|4|KB|Seismic Forecast Uncertainty| Clarifies difference between probability ranges vs deterministic predictions; why intervals matter. | Risk communication | Concept reinforcement | Builds on Ch3 & Ch6 reuse plan |
|5|ETH|Transparency vs Panic Debate| Release corrected index quickly (risk misinterpretation persists) vs pause to reframe (risk rumor expansion). | Ethical trade-offs | Nuanced stance | Narrator stance summary provided |
|6|SCN|Escalation: Secondary Breach| Log reveals simultaneous attempt to mask a sensor outage behind leaked noise; integrity risk spreads. | Cyber-physical security | Heightened stakes | Elevates sabotage sophistication |
|7|SCN|Partial Failure Acknowledgment| Team forced to issue interim advisory without full validation; public confusion persists. | Crisis management | Emotional dip | Defines trough before rebound |
|8|SYN|Pattern Board Update| Add ‘Information Hazard’ node; correlate leak timing with earlier damped seismic filters (Ch12) and forgery logs (Ch8). | Cross-case synthesis | Systems integration | Preps final consolidation |
|9|TRN|Forward Tag| Need comprehensive mosaic assembly to prevent fragmented communication—sets up synthesis chapter. | Foreshadow | Determination | Bridges to Ch14 |

Success Criteria: Clear emotional trough; uncertainty concept reused explicitly; failure not fully resolved; sets determination tone for synthesis push.
