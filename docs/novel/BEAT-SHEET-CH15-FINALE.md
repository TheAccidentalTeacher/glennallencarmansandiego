| # | Type | Title / Focus | Content Summary (No Prose) | Pedagogy | Output | Continuity / Notes |
|---|------|---------------|----------------------------|----------|--------|--------------------|
|1|LOG|Hook: Polar Corridor Flicker| High-latitude data corridor intermittently activates using archaic protocol signature. | Network evolution | Curiosity + urgency | Future arc hook |
|2|SCN|Arctic Arrival| Sensory: katabatic wind, low-angle light, sea ice mosaic; refurbished relay array. | Cryosphere context | Awe | Mirrors early altitude wonder |
|3|SCN|Legacy Relay Audit| Inspect dormant relays; find selective power cycling aligned with funding lapse intervals. | Infrastructure forensics | Causal clarity | Pays off maintenance gap motif |
|4|KB|Charter Principles| Raw Preservation, Layer Transparency, Ethical Delay Protocol, Community Co-Stewardship, Audit Traceability (concise list). | Governance framework | Concept consolidation | Draws from prior ethics beats |
|5|ETH|Charter Adoption Debate| Immediate global publication vs staged regional pilot. | Policy ethics | Responsible governance modeling | Final ethics stance summary |
|6|SCN|Escalation: Spiral Signal Emergence| Corridor nodes’ activation pattern forms partial spiral extending beyond original arc geometry. | Pattern evolution | Expanding scope awe | Future season invitation |
|7|SYN|Charter Ratification| Digital signing + immutable hash broadcast; pattern board archived with version tag. | Institutionalization | Responsibility | Closure artifact |
|8|SCN|Partial Insight & Ambiguity| One relay intentionally locked out by unknown actor—adversary network broader than detected. | Epistemic humility | Sustained intrigue | Prevents closed-world feel |
|9|TRN|Forward Tag / Epilogue Lead| Spiral reference logged; narrator invites continued vigilance and learning. | Forward momentum | Hope | Seamless into Epilogue |

Success Criteria: Charter synthesized from prior KB ethics; new motif (spiral) escalates scale; maintains narrative openness while concluding season arc.
