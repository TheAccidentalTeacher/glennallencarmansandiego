# Chapter 12 Beat Sheet (Draft 1): "Quiet Heat" (Pacific Geothermal)
Purpose: Present geothermal monitoring distinct from urban tectonic context; build hazard literacy; increase tension without yet delivering failure.

| # | Type | Title / Focus | Content Summary (No Prose) | Pedagogy | Output | Continuity / Notes |
|---|------|---------------|----------------------------|----------|--------|--------------------|
|1|LOG|Hook: Thermal/Seismic Paradox| Elevated surface thermal plume + gas emissions, but seismic accelerometers show abnormal calm below threshold. | Multi-dataset correlation | Analytical intrigue | Paradox hook distinguishes from later leak |
|2|SCN|Geothermal Field Survey| Sensory: sulfur tang, shifting steam vents, mineral color bands; local community drill practice audible. | Volcanic hydrothermal | Immersive hazard context | Distinct from urban infrastructure (next chapter) |
|3|SCN|Instrument Cross-Check| Cadet verifies calibration; duplicate accelerometer yields same calm; removes single-sensor error suspicion. | Measurement validation | Scientific rigor | Reinforces data trust methodology |
|4|KB|Geothermal System Basics| Heat source, groundwater circulation, vent expression; relation to plate boundaries. | Earth systems | Concept scaffold | Preps volcanic conduit comparison to qanat cooling principle |
|5|ETH|Alert Threshold Debate| Issue precautionary advisory (evac drills) vs avoid alarm (current seismic quiet). | Risk communication | Balanced judgment | Mirrors earlier timing ethics with higher stakes |
|6|SCN|Escalation: Gas Flux Spike| SO2 reading spikes regionally while seismic remains calm; suggests blocked conduit scenario. | Multi-parameter analysis | Heightened tension | Foreshadows potential future instability |
|7|SYN|Pattern Board Update| Add ‘Thermal-Seismic Divergence’ node; cross-links with airflow corridor spacing from Qanat. | Cross-domain mapping | Systems thinking | Builds toward leak vulnerability mapping |
|8|SCN|Partial Insight| Dr. Pacific hypothesizes intentional data damping attempt (seismic filter tamper) rather than genuine calm. | Data integrity | Suspicion elevation | Sets technical precedent for leak sabotage complexity |
|9|TRN|Forward Tag| Reference urban seismic infrastructure needing integrity review next. | Foreshadow | Anticipation | Bridges to Tectonic (Ch13) |

Success Criteria: Hazard presentation without failure; clear conceptual difference between geothermal natural system and upcoming urban risk management; ethics debate escalates stakes vs earlier agricultural timing.
