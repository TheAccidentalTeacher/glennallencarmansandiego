# Educator Alignment & Learning Objectives (Season 1)
Purpose: Map each chapter to primary learning objectives, Knowledge Boxes (KB), and suggested formative assessment prompts.

| Ch | Title (Short) | Primary Geo / STEM Focus | Core Ethics Angle | KB(s) Introduced | Reinforced KB(s) | Suggested Quick Check (QC) | Reflection Prompt |
|----|---------------|--------------------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| Intro | Induction | Inquiry cycle, map layers overview | Data authenticity baseline | KB-01 | — | QC: List the 4 steps of the Knowledge Cycle. | How does observing differ from questioning? |
| 2 | Altiplano | Elevation, relief, orographic effect | Data validation vs haste | KB-02, KB-03 | KB-01 | QC: Define relief in one sentence. | Why might altitude data be cached locally? |
| 3 | Meridian | Snowpack as reservoir, uncertainty intro | Early warning caution | KB-04, KB-05 | KB-02, KB-03 | QC: State purpose of uncertainty bands. | When is waiting for more data risky? |
| 4 | Atlas | Physical vs political boundaries, scale/distortion | Map authority governance | KB-06, KB-07 | KB-02–05 | QC: Give one difference physical vs political map. | Who decides when a map changes? |
| 5 | Coral | Bioacoustics as ecosystem indicator | Intervention timing | KB-08 | KB-06 | QC: What does a quiet reef suggest? | When should scientists intervene early? |
| 6 | Monsoon | Phenology, moisture timing | Advisory risk balance | KB-09 | KB-05 | QC: Name one monsoon onset indicator. | How do timing errors affect farmers? |
| 7 | Sahel | Migration corridors, data spoof detection | Access control vs openness | KB-10 | KB-09 | QC: Define a migration corridor. | Should all wildlife GPS data be public? |
| 8 | Watershed | Catchment hierarchy, forgery detection | Transparency scope | KB-11 | KB-04, KB-06 | QC: Order basin → tributary terms. | Why compare hashes of logs? |
| 9 | Canopy | Vertical stratification | Selective intervention ethics | KB-12 | KB-08 | QC: List the four canopy layers. | What risks exist in altering a single layer? |
| 10 | Sahara | Permit governance & erosion risk | Transparency vs protection | KB-13 | KB-06 | QC: Name two approval layers. | How can overexposure harm heritage sites? |
| 11 | Qanat | Subsurface hydrologic engineering | Equity vs security | KB-14 | KB-13 | QC: Purpose of ventilation shafts? | When is withholding structural detail ethical? |
| 12 | Pacific | Geothermal system dynamics | Precaution vs alarm | KB-15 | KB-14 | QC: State one geothermal component. | Why can heat rise while quakes stay quiet? |
| 13 | Tectonic | Urban seismic risk modeling, uncertainty reuse | Panic vs informed delay | KB-16 | KB-05, KB-15 | QC: Why include confidence intervals? | How does missing uncertainty mislead? |
| 14 | Synthesis | Anomaly taxonomy classification | Disclosure strategy | KB-17 | Multiple earlier KBs | QC: Name 3 anomaly categories. | Why classify anomalies before acting? |
| 15 | Finale | Governance charter principles | Global stewardship | KB-18 | KB-13–17 | QC: State one charter principle. | What responsibility follows knowing the pattern? |
| Epilogue | Epilogue | Forward application mindset | Sustained vigilance | — | KB-18 | QC: (Optional) Identify new motif. | Why leave some mysteries open? |

## Formative Assessment Guidance
- Quick Checks: 1–2 sentence answers; immediate retrieval practice.
- Reflection Prompts: Short paragraph; encourage transfer (connect prior chapters).
- Spiral Review: Mix earlier chapter QC items into later weeks (spacing).

## Master Learning Objectives by Theme
| Theme | Objective | Chapters Primarily Addressing |
|-------|-----------|-------------------------------|
| Terrain & Relief | Distinguish elevation vs relief & apply to hydrologic inference | 2–3, 12 |
| Hydrologic Systems | Trace water from snowpack/glacier through catchments to subsurface | 3, 8, 11 |
| Atmospheric & Climate Timing | Interpret phenological and orographic indicators for seasonal planning | 2, 3, 6 |
| Biodiversity Indicators | Use acoustic & stratification cues to infer ecosystem health | 5, 9 |
| Data Integrity & Validation | Detect forgery, spoofing, damping attempts across datasets | 7, 8, 12, 13 |
| Uncertainty & Risk Communication | Represent and explain forecast uncertainty ethically | 3, 6, 13 |
| Governance & Ethics | Evaluate transparency vs protection, equity vs access, charter formation | 10, 11, 14, 15 |
| Systems Synthesis | Integrate multi-domain anomalies into a predictive framework | 8, 14 |

## Instructor Usage Flow
1. Pre-Week: Skim beat sheet + KB entries; select 1 QC + 1 Reflection.
2. In-Game Week: Present hook anomaly visuals; pause at ETH beat for debate.
3. Post-Week: Issue reflection prompt; connect answer exemplars to charter principles.
4. Cumulative Weeks: Reintroduce earlier KB via quick retrieval (spaced practice).

## Differentiation Tips
- Support Struggling Learners: Provide graphic organizer for anomaly categories (post Ch14 KB).
- Enrichment: Ask advanced students to propose a new anomaly category extension (spiral motif tie-in).
- Cross-Curricular: Link governance debates to civics (charter parallels) and statistics (uncertainty interpretation).
