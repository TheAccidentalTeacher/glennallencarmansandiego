# Chapter 10 Beat Sheet (Draft 1): "Codes in the Sand" (Sahara Heritage)
Purpose: Introduce cultural governance ethics; differentiate desert heritage from subsurface engineering; set up adjacent Qanat chapter without redundancy.

| # | Type | Title / Focus | Content Summary (No Prose) | Pedagogy | Output | Continuity / Notes |
|---|------|---------------|----------------------------|----------|--------|--------------------|
|1|LOG|Hook: Permit Code Audit| Duplicate heritage excavation permit code surfaces in live registry; timestamp collision suggests forgery or clerical error. | Governance systems | Curiosity + skepticism | Distinct hook (administrative anomaly) |
|2|SCN|Desert Approach| Sensory: heat shimmer, dune migration markers, partial tarp over protected petroglyph. | Arid geomorphology | Environmental immersion | Visual contrast to canopy layers |
|3|SCN|Registry Triage| Compare hash/metadata: identical approval code but hidden reviewer checksum differs; potential tamper. | Data provenance | Analytical engagement | Leads into ethics stakes |
|4|KB|Permit Governance| Defines layered approval: Site Survey → Cultural Council → Environmental Impact → Final Auth Code; explains renewal & revocation triggers. | Civic process | Structural understanding | Used again in Charter drafting (Ch15) |
|5|ETH|Transparency vs Protection| Debate releasing full site coordinates (educational openness) vs risk of vandalism/looting. | Ethical stewardship | Nuanced judgment | Narrator adds stance summary |
|6|SCN|Escalation: Sandstorm Front| Incoming dust storm; LiDAR scans during reduced visibility show micro-erosion hotspots accelerating near contested zone. | Geospatial monitoring | Heightened urgency | Creates temporal pressure |
|7|SYN|Layered Risk Overlay| Cadet overlays erosion hotspots + permit boundaries; anomaly zone aligns with duplicate code perimeter. | Integrated mapping | Systems reasoning | Prepares linkage to subsurface flow (next chapter) |
|8|SCN|Partial Insight| Local steward clarifies second code requested expedited drainage assessment, not excavation; possible misuse of expedited channel. | Procedural nuance | Clarity with residual suspicion | Sets stage for subsurface angle |
|9|TRN|Forward Tag| Mention unexplained cool draft at dune scarp; suggests subterranean corridor check next. | Foreshadow | Anticipation | Bridges to Qanat Engineering (Ch11) |

Success Criteria: Administrative anomaly distinct from physical anomaly; ethics debate centers on information exposure; no early reveal of subsurface system (reserved for Ch11).
