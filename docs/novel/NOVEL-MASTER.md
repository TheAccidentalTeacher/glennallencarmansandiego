## 1. Premise & Core Dramatic Question
Premise: Atlas Corps trains global cadets to diagnose and neutralize environmental data sabotage threatening equitable stewardship of earth systems. Season 1 shadows the investigation across diverse biomes while building a governance charter.
Core Dramatic Question: Can the cadets establish trustworthy, ethically shared geospatial intelligence faster than escalating manipulations destabilize communities?

## 2. Structural Spine & Chapter Thumbnails
Macro Acts: Act I (Intro–Cartography): Orientation + pattern emergence. Act II (Coral–Qanat): Biome diversification + ethical complexity. Act III (Pacific–Finale): Hazard tension → setback → synthesis → governance.
Thumbnails:
1. Intro – Activation & anomaly ring foreshadow.
2. Mountains – Extraction ethics & elevation/relief literacy.
3. Glacial Transition – Uncertainty normalization.
4. Cartography Pivot – Physical vs political boundaries abstraction.
5. Coral – Quiet Data motif via acoustic absence.
6. Monsoon – Temporal conflict & risk timing.
7. Sahel – Access control & spoof ethics.
8. Watershed – Forgery + synthesis grid debut.
9. Canopy – Vertical stratification & selective layer absence.
10. Sahara Heritage – Permit governance ethics & erosion risk.
11. Qanat Engineering – Subsurface allocation equity & immersion rationale.
12. Pacific Geothermal – Multi-dataset hazard paradox.
13. Urban Tectonic – Data leak emotional trough.
14. Synthesis – Anomaly taxonomy & near closure.
15. Finale – Charter ratification + spiral future hook.
Epilogue – Open corridor flicker / sustained vigilance tone.

## 6. Beat Template & Usage Workflow
Beat Model (9): Hook Anomaly → Field Sensory → Data Triage/Hypothesis Fork → Knowledge Box → Ethical Micro-Debate/INT → Escalation/Twist → Synthesis Log → Partial Insight → Forward Tag.
Workflow: (1) Select Chapter Objective & KB; (2) Draft beats in table; (3) Expand to prose via scene template (prefer 1–2 paragraphs per beat); (4) Insert KB with strict format; (5) Validate continuity motifs & ethics stance; (6) Update Synthesis Grid (Ch8 onward) metadata.

## 7. Full Chapter Beat Sheets (Intro → 15)

## 8. Continuity & Risk Matrix (Condensed)
Issues: S1 predictable hooks → mitigated via taxonomy; S3 desert overlap → separated (Ch10 vs Ch11); T1 emotional trough absence → fixed at Ch13 leak; W1 world logic cause → Global Data Partition added.
Mitigations: Distinct hooks list locked; desert KB separation; leak at Ch13 midpoint; Synthesis 14 distinct from Finale 15.
Dependency Risks: Hook drift (maintain taxonomy), leak timing slide (fix), charter compression (avoid merge), uncertainty reuse omission (mandated Ch6 & 13).

## 9. Cross-Chapter Threads & Concept Reinforcement
Integration Artifacts: Pattern Board → Synthesis Grid → Mosaic.
Motif Chain: Quiet Data (reef) → Layer gap (canopy) → Damped seismic (Pacific/Tectonic) → Silent node ping (Synthesis) → Spiral (Finale).
Ethics Arc Progression: Data triage fairness → Intervention timing → Access control → Transparency vs panic (early) → Governance exposure vs protection → Allocation equity → High-stakes risk communication → Final disclosure governance → Charter codification.

## 10. Charter Principles (Canonical List)
1. Raw Preservation (store unfiltered sensor data with immutable hash).
2. Layer Transparency (declare all transformation layers & provenance).
3. Ethical Delay Protocol (defined criteria for brief withholding to validate anomalies).
4. Community Co-Stewardship (local stakeholders granted review access tier).
5. Audit Traceability (public checksum ledger for integrity verification).

## 11. Style, Tone, Voice & Dialogue Standards
Tone Cadence: Field scenes sensory-first; logs concise; KBs under 80 words; ethics debates balanced before narrator synthesis.
Reading Level: Middle-school accessible, concrete before abstraction, avoid unexplained jargon.
Dialogue Attribution: Role-based ("the data ethicist noted"), specialist names permissible; use collective group labels when summarizing consensus.

## 12. Ethical Stance Resolution Pattern
1. Present Dilemma → 2. Explore Positions → 3. Consider Consequences → 4. Narrator Synthesis (non-didactic) → 5. Forward Application link to governance principle or future risk.

## 13. Educational Integration & Classroom Use
Weekly Release: Each chapter’s beats + KB + two reflection prompts (recap + transfer). Assessment Mapping: Use KB IDs to auto-generate formative items. Spacing Strategy: Reinforce each concept within two chapters of intro. Synthesis Activities: After Ch8 & Ch14 students reconstruct grid/taxonomy.

## 14. Expansion & Future Hook Seeds
Spiral Motif: Expands ring into multi-layer network. Polar Corridor: Sets Stage for cryosphere-focused Season 2. AI Triage Assistant Prototype: Optional emergent tool. Charter Adoption Friction: Regional variance arc.

## 15. Deprecation & Versioning Notes
Original files retained (READ-ONLY). Update Policy: Modify this master; propagate critical schema changes (e.g., KB IDs) back as header notices in legacy files if absolutely needed. Version Tagging: Use semantic narrative versioning (v1.0 initial consolidation). Next potential increment: v1.1 after first prose drafting round.
