# Chapter 11 Beat Sheet (Draft 1): "Veins Beneath the Dunes" (Qanat Engineering)
Purpose: Reveal subsurface hydrology system, deepen engineering ethics (allocation equity), provide immersion training rationale distinct from heritage governance.

| # | Type | Title / Focus | Content Summary (No Prose) | Pedagogy | Output | Continuity / Notes |
|---|------|---------------|----------------------------|----------|--------|--------------------|
|1|LOG|Hook: Airflow/Moisture Corridor| Cool airflow + elevated humidity detected along linear dune transect at pre-dawn—anomaly not present in prior seasonal logs. | Subsurface detection | Analytical curiosity | Distinct physical anomaly hook |
|2|SCN|Pre-Dawn Transect Walk| Sensory: faint cool draft, granular temperature gradient, subtle damp crust in narrow band. | Field observation | Embodied inference | Follows heritage governance emphasis with physical mystery |
|3|SCN|Sensor Array Triage| Deploy temp + humidity micro-loggers; data shows consistent 2°C depression along corridor vs control points. | Microclimate profiling | Comparative reasoning | Quantifies anomaly |
|4|KB|Qanat Engineering| Gravity-fed tunnel gradient, ventilation shafts, passive cooling, sustainable draw principles. | Hydrologic engineering | Structural comprehension | Feeds later volcanic conduit analogy |
|5|INT|Immersion Rationale| Specialist explains cultural immersion training (language, customs) improved local reporting fidelity & trust for maintenance access. | Cultural methodology | Trust model | Justifies prior "disguise" perception |
|6|SCN|Escalation: Collapsed Vent Shaft| Partial sink near corridor exposes disused shaft; airflow intensifies; structural risk rises. | Structural integrity | Heightened stakes | Sets safety urgency |
|7|ETH|Allocation Equity Debate| Release full tunnel map (equitable planning) vs redact vulnerable shafts (security & misuse prevention). | Resource ethics | Nuanced stance | Narrator summary clarifies best practice |
|8|SYN|Hydro-Structural Overlay| Cadet overlays heritage erosion map (from Ch10) with corridor; shows protection synergy if jointly managed. | Cross-chapter integration | Systems perspective | Reinforces separation w/ synergy |
|9|TRN|Forward Tag| Subsurface airflow pattern echoes missing seismic node spacing; narrator points toward geothermal paradox next. | Foreshadow | Anticipation | Bridges to Pacific (Ch12) |

Success Criteria: Distinct hook modality; engineering KB separate from governance KB; immersion rationale delivered before equity debate; sets stage for hazard arc by pattern spacing reference.
