# Beat Sheets (Intro – Chapter 4) Centralized Copy

Migrated reference of previously authored beats for continuity alignment. (Condensed formatting.)

## Intro (Activation)
- Hook: Atlas Control detects fragmented anomaly ring; funding freeze context.
- Field Beat: Sensors boot; quiet nodes logged.
- Data Triager: Missing arc nodes; preliminary map overlay.
- KB: None (orientation segment). 
- Ethical Micro-Debate: Data triage prioritization fairness.
- Twist: Pattern resembles deliberate ring not random outages.
- Synthesis Log: Board started; “Arc-13?” chalked.
- Resolution: Proceed to high-altitude cluster.
- Forward Tag: “Elevation will clarify signal horizon.”

## Chapter 2 (Mountains)
- Hook: Irregular snowmelt gradient near mining zone.
- Field Beat: Thin ridge air; active machinery hum.
- Data Triager: Snowpack cores vs satellite albedo mismatch.
- KB: Elevation vs Relief.
- Ethical: Extraction contract compliance vs local hydrology.
- Twist: Melt timing offset forming segment of ring geometry.
- Synthesis: Adds segment; ring partial.
- Resolution: Secure next alpine dataset.
- Forward Tag: Need transitional glacier reference.

## Chapter 3 (Glacial Transition)
- Hook: Anomalous blue ice band thickness shift.
- Field: Crevasse acoustics; meltwater underfoot.
- Data Triager: Thickness transect vs historic spread.
- KB: Uncertainty Bands.
- Ethical: Resource allocation for long-term monitoring.
- Twist: Deviations align with prior mining offsets.
- Synthesis: Confidence overlay updated.
- Resolution: Cartographic integration required.
- Forward Tag: Boundary abstraction upcoming.

## Chapter 4 (Cartography Pivot)
- Hook: Border mismatch between physical watershed & administrative map.
- Field: Survey drones trace ridge shadows.
- Data Triager: Political vs physical overlay clash.
- KB: Physical vs Political Boundaries (plus recap insertion planned).
- Ethical: Water rights vs extraction licensing.
- Twist: Ring segments map onto trans-boundary oversight gaps.
- Synthesis: Multi-layer board now 40% complete.
- Resolution: Expand to marine acoustic domain.
- Forward Tag: “Sound can vanish before color fades.”
