# (Archived) Merge Planning: Sahara Heritage + Qanat Engineering

Original Goal (Superseded): Fuse desert cultural heritage preservation arc with subsurface water engineering identity twist into a single cohesive chapter.

## 1. Core Functions to Preserve
| Original Sahara Thread | Original Qanat Thread | Merge Outcome |
|------------------------|-----------------------|--------------|
| Artifact site erosion risk | Subsurface tunnel mapping | Integrated surface-subsurface context |
| Heritage permit bureaucracy | Water access equity | Permit duplication mystery ties to water allocation fairness |
| Sandstorm data interruption | Moisture gradient tracking | Storm event reveals moisture anomalies that expose hidden tunnel segment |
| Cultural liaison role emphasis | Disguise via immersion training | Cultural liaison becomes vantage explaining immersion necessity |
| Ethical debate: preservation vs study | Ethical: data withholding to protect sites | Single multi-faceted debate balancing transparency, site protection, equitable use |

## 2. Hook Redesign
Legacy: Equipment theft.
New Hook Modality (Composite Administrative Anomaly): Two identical permit approval codes surface at separate heritage-water interface sites issued same timestamp.

Impact: Immediately frames dual-site reality, invites authenticity validation, sets up identity reveal.

## 3. Chapter Beat Intent Draft (Skeleton)
(Will be conformed to 9-beat template later.)
1. Hook (LOG): Duplicate permit codes; potential clerical error or forgery.
2. Field Sensory (SCN): Sand-laden wind + subtle cool draft near dune base (implying subsurface void airflow). 
3. Data Triage (SCN): Compare permit metadata hashes; discover diverging reviewer initials embedded invisibly.
4. Knowledge Box (KB): Qanat Principles – gravity-fed tunnel, ventilation shafts, historical sustainability role.
5. Ethical Debate (ETH): Publicizing precise tunnel maps (risk looting) vs restricted release (risk inequitable water control).
6. Escalation (SCN): Sandstorm front causes LIDAR scatter; brief window reveals linear moisture differential.
7. Synthesis (SYN): Overlay heritage site erosion risk with subsurface moisture corridor; dual-value conservation map.
8. Partial Insight (SCN/INT): Identity Reveal: Specialist’s 'disguise' not deception but sanctioned cultural immersion training enabling trust with local stewards.
9. Forward Tag (TRN): Moisture corridor vector added to global pattern board—aligns with unfilled arc gap.

## 4. Identity Reveal Handling
- Avoid melodrama; clarify institutional protocol for context-embedding.
- Emphasize linguistic & customary fluency as data quality enhancer.
- Frame reveal as demonstration of ethical, respectful integration methodology, not spy tactic.

## 5. Ethical Axes Active
| Axis | Expression in Chapter | Resolution Stance (Proposed) |
|------|-----------------------|------------------------------|
| Transparency vs Protection | Decide partial map release | Publish generalized corridor + anonymized depth, keep precise shafts internal audit-only |
| Heritage vs Development | Proposed tourism expansion vs aquifer sustainability | Prioritize preservation; require environmental impact baseline first |
| Access vs Equity | Who governs water allocation | Community co-steward charter clause preview |

## 6. Required Foreshadow Insertions Upstream
| Target Chapter | Foreshadow Element | Implementation Cue |
|----------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Ch7 (Sahel) | Reference historical desert water corridors enabling migrations | ETH beat add-on line |
| Ch8 (Watershed) | Mention subterranean flows interacting with surface basin divides | KB extension note |
| Ch9 (Rainforest) | Contrast vertical water cycling vs subsurface arid storage | Closing synthesis line |

## 7. Data / Visual Artifacts to Produce
- Dual-layer map: Surface erosion hotspots + subsurface moisture corridor.
- Permit code metadata diff (hash snippet illustration placeholder).
- Simplified qanat cross-section (vent shaft, tunnel grade, collection point).

## 8. Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Overstuffed exposition | M | Clutter | Keep KB concise; push heritage context detail to partial insight beat |
| Identity reveal feels trivial | L | Flat emotional beat | Tie reveal to immediate practical gain (local stewards accept mitigation plan) |
| Permit anomaly too technical | M | Reader disengagement | Use contrasting colored stamps metaphor for duplicate codes |

## 9. Success Criteria
- Single hook gracefully unites both original case purposes.
- Identity reveal advances trust & ethical methodology themes.
- Qanat KB provides just enough engineering depth to support later synthesis without derailment.
- Sets up Charter co-stewardship clause (Ch14) logically.
