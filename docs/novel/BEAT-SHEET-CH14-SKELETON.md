# Chapter 14 Skeleton: "Northern Vault"
Purpose: Lock finale thematic + structural beats before mid-act expansions to prevent scope drift. Maintain ambiguity of larger network while resolving season arc (Charter + pattern exposure).

| # | Type | Title / Focus | Intent (No Prose) | Pedagogy | Emotional Tone | Continuity / Notes |
|---|------|---------------|-------------------|----------|----------------|--------------------|
|1|LOG|Hook: Polar Corridor Flicker| New high-latitude data corridor activates intermittently (not part of original arc). | Data networks | Surprise & intrigue | Hooks Season 2 while relevant now |
|2|SCN|Arctic Approach| Sensory: katabatic wind, low-angle light, sea ice mosaic; team arrival. | Cryosphere context | Awe | Mirrors early altitude sensory beats (ring closure) |
|3|SCN|Vault Exterior Survey| Facility: modular research hub + legacy relay dishes partly decommissioned. | Infrastructure evolution | Curiosity | Ties to Global Data Partition origin |
|4|KB|Open Data Charter Principles| Lists 5 draft tenets: Raw Preservation, Layer Transparency, Ethical Delay Protocol, Community Co-stewardship, Audit Traceability. | Data governance | Empowerment | Sums ethics arc threads |
|5|ETH|Charter Adoption Debate| Immediate release vs phased pilot; risk of misuse vs trust-building. | Governance trade-offs | Tension | Echoes Ch8 risk governance & Ch12 panic mitigation |
|6|SCN|Escalation: Ring Pattern Resolution| Synthesis Grid projects full arc; missing nodes correspond to deliberate silence shield. | Pattern synthesis | Determination | Pays off foreshadow (13 nodes) |
|7|SYN|Charter Ratification Scene| Cadets finalize charter clauses; digital signing ceremony logs immutable hash. | Institutionalization | Responsibility | Creates closure artifact |
|8|SCN|Partial Insight + Ambiguity| Discovery: one relay still obfuscating source; network larger than detected. | Epistemic humility | Unease + resolve | Leaves antagonist layer open |
|9|TRN|Forward Teaser| Polar flicker stabilizes into a new geometric motif (spiral); narrator invites next-season inquiry. | Pattern evolution | Hopeful curiosity | Spiral supersedes ring motif |

Open Variables to Finalize in Full Draft Phase:
- Exact number of Charter signatory entities.
- Spiral motif data rationale (ice melt radar interference? placeholder).
- Which specialist sends final asynchronous message acknowledging cadet leadership.

Success Criteria:
- Pays off 13-node foreshadow.
- Integrates all four ethics debate dimensions (access, timing, authority, transparency).
- Closes emotional arc on Responsibility â†’ Hope.
- Leaves meta-plot thread (larger network) intentionally unresolved but advanced.
