# Chapter 9 Beat Sheet (Draft 1): "Layers of Life" (Rainforest Canopy)
Purpose: Showcase vertical stratification, extend layering motif, introduce anomaly via missing mid-canopy acoustic/species signal; escalate integration complexity toward heritage/desert merge.

| # | Type | Title / Focus | Content Summary (No Prose) | Pedagogy | Output | Continuity / Notes |
|---|------|---------------|----------------------------|----------|--------|--------------------|
|1|LOG|Hook: Mid-Canopy Signal Gap| Biodiversity sampling shows normal understory + emergent species counts, but mid-layer acoustic & camera metrics suppressed 35%. | Stratification metrics | Curiosity + analytical puzzle | Completes hook variety progression (selective layer absence) |
|2|SCN|Ascending Tower Entry| Cadet climbs modular canopy tower; sensory detail: filtered green light, layered humidity, insect pitch shift. | Vertical profiling | Immersive spatial model | Mirrors reef sound layering contrast Ch5 |
|3|SCN|Layer Comparison Scan| Side-by-side dashboard: Understory insect density, Mid-layer depressed pollinator activity, Emergent bird count stable. | Comparative analysis | Pattern recognition | Reinforces 'repetition with variation' pedagogy |
|4|KB|Rainforest Stratification| Defines layers: forest floor, understory, mid-canopy, emergent; light & moisture gradients; niche partitioning. | Ecosystem structure | Concept anchoring | Layer motif bridging to seismic stratigraphy later |
|5|ETH|Selective Intervention Debate| Release supplemental pollinator attractant? Risk altering study baseline vs safeguarding pollination services. | Conservation ethics | Nuanced decision framing | Parallel to reef intervention (Ch5) escalation |
|6|SCN|Escalation: Thermal Drone Pass| Infrared reveals mid-layer cooler patch corridor forming partial arc segment; suggests airflow disruption or external shading. | Remote sensing | Heightened intrigue | Arc motif subtle reinforcement without overexposure |
|7|SYN|Pattern Board Update| Adds 'Vertical Differential Gap' node; links layering across snowpack, map abstraction, reef sound, canopy ecology. | Cross-domain abstraction | Systems consolidation | Preps conceptual leap to subsurface desert layer (Ch10) |
|8|SCN|Partial Insight| Discovery: Mid-canopy sensor cluster firmware recently rolled back; potential forced regression to hide anomaly origin (sabotage tactic variant). | Data provenance | Suspicion + competence | Introduces firmware manipulation tactic |
|9|TRN|Forward Tag| Note: Desert subsurface storage analog to hidden mid-layer; narrator foreshadows dual-layer conservation map ahead. | Analogy mapping | Anticipation | Bridges to merged Sahara/Qanat chapter |

Differentiators: Vertical acoustic & thermal pattern focuses on structure-function interplay rather than purely species count; ties layering motif explicitly across domains, reinforcing educational abstraction strategy.

Open Items for Later Refinement:
- Specific pollinator taxa placeholder (choose age-appropriate recognizable example).
- Exact thermal differential value (target 2–3°C contrast) to maintain plausibility.

Success Criteria:
- Maintains novelty without new hook class invention (selective absence as variant of absence theme).
- Strengthens motif chain leading into subsurface desert layering.
- Introduces firmware sabotage vector (elevates antagonist sophistication).
