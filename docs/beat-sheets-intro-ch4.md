Learning Emphasis Recap (Intro): Inquiry cycle, map layer differentiation, collaborative ethos, data integrity lens.

## Standard Knowledge Box Formatting (Locked)
Example Template:
Term: Orographic Effect  
Definition: When moist air rises over mountains, it cools and drops rain or snow on the windward side, leaving the leeward side drier.  
Memory Hook: "Up, cool, drop."  

## Deliverable Status
- Beats Intro–4 complete (no prose, structured, export-friendly).
- Each beat includes pedagogical tagging and future continuity references.
- Ready to replicate pattern for Chapters 5–14 once continuity analysis (next task) refines variation strategy.

## Recommended Next Step Options
A. Generate continuity & plot hole analysis doc now (to adjust later beat diversity).  
B. Extend beat sheets to Chapters 5–8.  
C. Expand knowledge box inventory (full season).  
D. All of the above (specify order).  

Indicate your selection and I’ll proceed.
