### Next Phase Preview: Phase 2 - Pilot Case Conversions
**Target**: Convert 2-3 cases to validate educational framework and technical integration

**Recommended Starting Cases**:
1. **Dr. Altiplano (Andean Mining)** - Good physical geography focus
2. **Dr. Coral (Marine Research)** - Strong cultural and economic elements  
3. **Professor Atlas (Boundary Mapping)** - Excellent for borders and political geography

**Phase 2 Goals**:
- Transform complex academic clues to 11-year-old language
- Integrate I-Can statements and learning targets
- Test enhanced cases with existing API/frontend
- Validate educational progression through 5 rounds
- Confirm research-ability with physical tools

### User Decision Point
