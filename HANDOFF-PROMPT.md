## ðŸŽ¯ IMMEDIATE STATUS: IMAGE SYSTEM WORKING!

**JUST COMPLETED:** 5-Image Educational Progression System implementation for Dr. Altiplano case

### What's Working Right Now âœ…
- **Cases Tab**: Loads and displays with round-specific images  
- **Villains Tab**: Image gallery displays all character portraits
- **Round Progression**: Dr. Altiplano case shows 5 different images per educational phase
- **Static File Serving**: All villain images serve correctly via `/images/villains/` 
- **API + Frontend**: Both servers start reliably with simple commands

### Quick Test (Verify This Works)
1. Start servers: `npm start` (API) + `npm run dev` (frontend)  
2. Open http://localhost:5173
3. Go to **Cases** â†’ "The Andean Mining Operation Sabotage"
4. Each round should show different Dr. Altiplano images (15-19)
5. **Villains** tab should show full image gallery

## ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

### Fixed Components
- **CasePreview.tsx**: Round-to-image mapping with correct folder prefixes  
- **server.ts**: Static file serving for villain + case images
- **VillainManagement.tsx**: Image URL construction corrected
- **Image URLs**: Use full path like `/images/villains/04-dr-altiplano-isabella-santos/`

### 8/12 Cases Ready with Image Integration âœ…
1. Dr. Altiplano - Andean Mining (FULLY WORKING)
2. Dr. Sahel - Wildlife Tracking  
3. Dr. Monsoon - Weather Station
4. Dr. Coral - Marine Research  
5. Dr. Qanat - Ancient Irrigation
6. Professor Atlas - Boundary Mapping
7. Dr. Pacific - Ring of Fire
8. Sourdough Pete - Alaska Demo

## NEXT DEVELOPMENT PHASE ðŸš€
